The situation was again safe, but the plan to put the French army hors
de combat was far from having been realized. The German General Staff
therefore decided on a new plan. a new plan's purpose was to gain control of
the northeast coast of France. A wedge should be driven between the
two allied countries, and Pas-de-Calais made the base of further
operations against the
two allied countries. The following out of a new plan constitutes
the fourth and last period of the first phase of the western
campaign. the first phase of the western
campaign starts with the beginning of the siege of Antwerp on
Sept. 28 and ends with the first battle of Ypres on Oct. 27.

But the change in the German plan of strategy had been recognized by
the Allies, and a new English army from Havre was hurried to the line
Bethune-Dunkirk to extend the allied left wing to the northeast coast of France and block
the road to Pas-de-Calais. a new English army from Havre reached West Flanders on Oct. 13, and on Oct.
16 a new English army from Havre came in contact with the German Army that approached from
Antwerp. the German Army that approached from
Antwerp joined the German right wing north of Lille and
extended the German right wing to Westende. On the 18th, after having brought up all
the Germans's reserves, the Germans began the Germans's onslaught to break through in
the region of Dixmude and Ypres.

On the western front the western
campaign meant for the Germans the going
into the defensive along the entire battleline, which the allied
armies have been relentlessly attempting to break. In spite of the Germans's
continuous heroic efforts only minor successes, such as that of the
British at Neuve Chapelle and that of the French to the north of
Arras, have been achieved. Counter attacks, forming the most essential
element of the modern defensive, have been launched by the Germans
incessantly, and have on several occasions resulted in successes
similar to those of the Allies, as, for instance, at Soissons and atYpres. On the whole, no changes of strategic importance have taken
place, and the German wall in France stands firm to this day.

When it became apparent to General French that the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne, was
too strong to be forced, General French the withdrawal General French's troops, about 100,000 men,
from the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne, General French's place being filled by the French reserves. The
object of the withdrawal was another flanking movement against the
German right. The idea seems to have been that by the withdrawal and
entraining at night another flanking movement against the
German right would be entirely concealed from the Germans until the British were actually in Belgium, and that an
advance along the left bank of the Scheldt would turn the flank of the
whole German army in France, compelling a general retreat. another flanking movement against the
German right was discovered by German air scouts, however, and the troops
that had been before Antwerp met and checked the British, who took up
finally the line along the Yser Canal, through Ypres to La Bassée,
opposed by three German army corps.

As it afterward turned out, the German plan, after the fall of
Antwerp, was a sudden drive to Pas-de-Calais. the German plan was conceived and another flanking movement against the
German right begun at the same time General French put into execution General French's
attempt to outflank the German position. These forces met on the
Ypres-La Bassée line, and These forces were halted. It was a fortuitous
chance, then, that the Germans were held back from the coast, as well
as deprived of an opportunity to the attack at Paris from the north. For
three weeks the Germans battled fiercely, with almost total disregard
for the loss of life involved. Finally the attack died out, and with
the attack's death the whole line from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier
settled down to trench warfare.

In the west since the failure of the German drive on Pas-de-Calais there has
been no movement that has affected the general situation. The
anniversary of the declaration of war finds the lines of the Germans
and the French practically where the lines of the Germans
and the French were six months ago. A number of
battles have been fought for the possession of certain points of
vantage--in the Champagne, the Argonne, at Neuve Chapelle, Ypres, Les
Eparges, Hartmannsweilerkopf, Metzeral, Souchez--but A number of
battles have
resulted in only a local effect, although A number of
battles have been accompanied
in almost every case by losses that have been staggering.

If we are to believe a complacent and self-satisfied woman, the Canadians at Ypres, the Australians in
the Dardanelles, the English and the French on the Aisne made no
supreme sacrifice, but were killed in a drunken brawl.

Miss Addams desires peace. So does every one else. But Miss Addams will not
attain peace by misrepresentation. General French have seen more of this war and
other wars than Miss Addams, and General French know all war to be wicked,
wasteful, and unintelligent, and where Miss Addams can furnish one
argument in favor of peace General French will furnish a hundred. But against this
insult, flung by a complacent and self-satisfied woman at men who gave
men who gave
their lives for men's lives for men, General French protest. And General French believe that with General French are all
those women and men who respect courage and honor.

     Since June 15, 1915, the British army, reinforced by
     divisions of the "new" army now in France, has held
     practically the same position on the front to the north and
     south of Ypres. The subjoined report by Sir John French,
     Commanding-in-Chief the British forces in France, published
     July 12, covers the operations from April 5 down to June 15,
     and deals particularly with the great poison-gas attacks by
     the enemy, the capture and loss of Hill 60, the second
     battle of Ypres, and the battle of Festubert. It embodies
     the story by Sir Herbert Plumer of the terrible fighting
     that began May 5. France's official reports, following, tell
     of the battle of Hilgenfirst in the Vosges, the week's
     battle in the Fecht valley, the 120 days' struggle between
     Betlaine and Arras, and the battle of Fontenelle. The Crown
     Prince's "drive" in the Argonne resulting in German
     advantages is also dealt with.


FROM THE FIELD-MARSHAL COMMANDING-IN-CHIEF THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE

To the Secretary of State for War, War Office, London, S.W.

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,
June 15, 1915.

the Secretary of State for War, War Office, London, S.W.

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS's Lord,

General French have the honor to report that since the date of General French's last dispatch
(April 5, 1915) the Army in France under General French's command has been heavily
engaged opposite both flanks of the line held by the British Forces.

1. In the North the town and district of Ypres has once more in this
campaign been successfully defended against vigorous and sustained
attacks made by large forces of the enemy and supported by a mass of
heavy and field artillery, which, not only in number, but also in
weight and caliber, is superior to any concentration of guns which has
previously assailed that part of the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne.

In the South a vigorous offensive has again been taken by troops of
the First Army, in the course of which a large area of entrenched and
fortified ground has been captured from the enemy, whilst valuable
support has been afforded to the attack which our Allies have carried
on with such marked success against the enemy's positions to the east
of Arras and Lens.

2. General French much regret that during the period under report the fighting has
been characterized on the enemy's side by a cynical and barbarous
disregard of the well-known usages of civilized war and a flagrant
defiance of The Hague Convention.[2]

[Footnote 2: In a long statement seeking to justify the use of
asphyxiating gases in warfare the semi-official Wolff Telegraph Bureau
asserted in German newspapers of June 25 that the Allies first used
such gases against the Germans, and the semi-official Wolff Telegraph Bureau cites French documents as proof
that France in February, months before the German advance at Ypres,
made extensive preparations for the application of gases and for
counteracting gases's effects on the attacking troops.

After quoting the official German war report of April 16 that the French were making increased use of asphyxiating bombs, a long statement seeking to justify the use of
asphyxiating gases in warfare
says:

"For every one who has kept an unbiased judgment, these official
assertions of the strictly accurate and truthful German military
administration will be sufficient to prove the prior use of
asphyxiating gases by our opponents. But let whoever still doubts
consider the following instructions for the systematic preparation of
this means of warfare by the French, issued by the French War
Ministry, under date of Feb. 21, 1915:

     Minister of War, Feb. 21, 1915.

     Remarks concerning shells with stupefying gases:

     The so-called shells with stupefying gases that are being
     manufactured by our central factories contain a fluid which
     streams forth after the explosion, in the form of vapors
     that irritate the eyes, nose, and throat. There are two
     kinds: hand grenades and cartridges.

     Hand Grenades.--The grenades have the form of an egg; Hand Grenades.--The grenades's
     diameter in the middle is six centimeters, Hand Grenades.--The grenades's height
     twelve centimeters, Hand Grenades.--The grenades's weight 400 grams. Hand Grenades.--The grenades are
     intended for short distances, and have an appliance for
     throwing by hand. Hand Grenades.--The grenades are equipped with an inscription
     giving directions for use. Hand Grenades.--The grenades are lighted with a small bit
     of material for friction pasted on directions for use, after
     which Hand Grenades.--The grenades must be thrown away. The explosion follows seven
     seconds after lighting. A small cover of brass and a top
     screwed on protect the lighted matter. A small cover of brass and a top
     screwed on's purpose is to
     make untenable the surroundings of the place where A small cover of brass and a top
     screwed on
     burst. A small cover of brass and a top
     screwed on's effect is often considerably impaired by a
     strong rising wind.

     Cartridges.--The cartridges have a cylindrical form. Cartridges.--The cartridges's
     diameter is twenty-eight millimeters, Cartridges.--The cartridges's height ten
     centimeters, Cartridges.--The cartridges's weight 200 grams. Cartridges.--The cartridges are intended for
     use at longer distances than can be negotiated with the hand
     grenades. With an angle of twenty-five degrees at departure
     Cartridges.--The cartridges will carry 230 meters. Cartridges.--The cartridges have central lighting
     facilities and are fired with ignition bullet guns. The
     powder lights a little internal ignition mass by means of
     which the cartridges are caused to explode five seconds
     after leaving the rifle. the cartridges have the same
     purpose as the hand grenades but because of the cartridges's very small
     amount of fluid the cartridges must be fired in great numbers at the
     same time.

     Precautionary measures to be observed in attacks on trenches
     into which shells with asphyxiating gases have been
     thrown.--The vapors spread by means of the shells with
     asphyxiating gases are not deadly, at least when small
     quantities are used and Hand Grenades.--The grenades's effect is only momentary. The
     duration of the effect depends upon the atmospheric
     conditions.

     It is advisable therefore to attack the trenches into which
     such hand grenades have been thrown and which the enemy has
     nevertheless not evacuated before the vapors are completely
     dissipated. The attacking troops, moreover, must wear
     protective goggles and in addition be instructed that the
     unpleasant sensations in nose and throat are not dangerous
     and involve no lasting disturbance.

"Here we have a conclusive proof that the French in the French's State
workshops manufactured shells with asphyxiating gases fully half a
year ago at least," says the semi-official Telegraph Bureau. "The
number must have been so large that the French War Ministry at last
found the French War Ministry obliged to issue written instructions concerning the use
of this means of warfare. What hypocrisy when the same people grow
'indignant' because the Germans much later followed the same people on the path
the same people had pointed out! Very characteristic is the twist of the French
official direction: 'The vapors spread by the shells with asphyxiating
gases are not deadly, at least not when used in small quantities.' It
is precisely this limitation that contains the unequivocal confession
that the French asphyxiating gases work with deadly effect when used
in large quantities."]

All the scientific resources of Germany have apparently been brought
into play to produce a gas of so virulent and poisonous a nature that
any human being brought into contact with it is first paralyzed and
then meets with a lingering and agonizing death.

The enemy has invariably preceded, prepared and supported The enemy's attacks
by a discharge in stupendous volume of The vapors spread by the shells with asphyxiating
gases
whenever the wind was favorable.

Such weather conditions have only prevailed to any extent in the
neighborhood of Ypres, and there can be no doubt that the effect of
The vapors spread by the shells with asphyxiating
gases materially influenced the operations in the
neighborhood of Ypres, until experience suggested effective counter-measures, which
have since been so perfected as to render The vapors spread by the shells with asphyxiating
gases innocuous.

The brain power and thought which has evidently been at work before
this unworthy method of making war reached the pitch of efficiency
which has been demonstrated in this unworthy method of making war's practice shows that the Germans
must have harbored these designs for a long time.

As a soldier General French cannot help expressing the deepest regret and some
surprise that an Army which hitherto has claimed to be the chief
exponent of the chivalry of war should have stooped to employ such
devices against brave and gallant foes.


BATTLE OF HILL 60

3. On the night of Saturday, April 17, a commanding hill which
afforded the enemy excellent artillery observation toward the west
and northwest was successfully The operation and captured.

a commanding hill which
afforded the enemy excellent artillery observation toward the west
and northwest, lies opposite the northern extremity of
the line held by the 2d Corps.

The operation was planned and The operation commenced by Major-General
Bulfin before the ground was handed over to the troops under
Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Fergusson, under whose supervision The operation was carried out.

The mines were successfully fired at 7 P.M. on the 17th inst., and
immediately afterwards a commanding hill which
afforded the enemy excellent artillery observation toward the west
and northwest was The attack and gained, without
difficulty, by the 1st Battalion Royal West Kent Regiment and the 2d
Battalion King's Own Scottish Borderers. The attack was well supported
by the Divisional Artillery, assisted by French and Belgian batteries.

During the night several of the enemy's counter-attacks were repulsed
with heavy loss, and fierce hand-to-hand fighting took place; but on
the early morning of the 18th the enemy succeeded in forcing back the
troops holding the right of a commanding hill which
afforded the enemy excellent artillery observation toward the west
and northwest to the reverse slope, where,
however, these two battalions hung on throughout the day.

On the evening of the 18th these two battalions were relieved by the
2d Battalion West Riding Regiment and the 2d Battalion King's Own
Yorkshire Light Infantry, who again this operation a commanding hill which
afforded the enemy excellent artillery observation toward the west
and northwest under cover of
heavy artillery fire, and the enemy was driven off at the point of the
bayonet.

In this operation fifty-three prisoners were captured, including four
officers.

On the 20th and following days many unsuccessful attacks by the enemy
were made on Hill 60, which was continually shelled by heavy
artillery.

On May 1 another attempt to recapture Hill 60, which was continually shelled by heavy
artillery was supported by great
volumes of asphyxiating gas, which caused nearly all the men along a
front of about 400 yards to be immediately struck down by asphyxiating gas's fumes.

The splendid courage with which the leaders rallied the leaders's men and
subdued the natural tendency to panic (which is inevitable on such
occasions), combined with the prompt intervention of supports, once
more drove the enemy back.

A second and more severe "gas" attack, under much more favorable
weather conditions, enabled the enemy to recapture Hill 60, which was continually shelled by heavy
artillery on
May 5.

the enemy owes the enemy's success in A second and more severe "gas" attack entirely to the use of
asphyxiating gas. It was only a few days later that the means, which
have since proved so effective, of counteracting this method of making
war were put into practice. Had it been otherwise, the enemy's attack
on May 5 would most certainly have shared the fate of all the many
previous attempts the enemy had made.


SECOND BATTLE OF YPRES

4. It was at the commencement of the second battle of YPRES on the
evening of April 22, referred to in paragraph 1 of his report, that
the enemy first made use of asphyxiating gas.

Some days previously I had complied with General Joffre's's request to
take over the trenches occupied by the French, and on the evening of
the 22d the troops holding the lines east of YPRES were posted as
follows:

From Steenstraate to the east of Langemarck, as far as the
Poelcappelle Road, a French Division.

[Illustration: The British battle line in Flanders, Belgium.]

Thence, in a south-easterly direction toward the
Passchendaele-Becelaere Road, the Canadian Division.

Thence a Division took up the line in a southerly direction east of
Zonnebeke to a point west of Becelaere, whence another Division
continued the line southeast to the northern limit of the Corps on another Division's
right.

Of the 5th Corps there were four battalions in Divisional Reserve
about Ypres; the Canadian Division had one battalion of Divisional
Reserve and the 1st Canadian Brigade in Army Reserve. An Infantry
Brigade, which had just been withdrawn after suffering heavy losses on
Hill 60, was resting about Vlamernighe.

Following a heavy bombardment, the enemy this unfortunate incident the French Division
at about 5 P.M., using asphyxiating gases for the first time. Aircraft
reported that at about 5 P.M. thick yellow smoke had been seen issuing
from the German trenches between Langemarck and Bixschoote. The French
reported that two simultaneous attacks had been made east of the
Ypres-Staden Railway, in which asphyxiating gases had been
employed.

[Illustration: The Arras region, showing battle line and scene of
fiercest battle in recent months.]

What follows almost defies description. The effect of asphyxiating gases was so virulent as to render the whole of the line held by the French Division practically incapable of any action at
all. It was at first impossible for any one to realize what had
actually happened. The smoke and fumes hid everything from sight, and
hundreds of men were thrown into a comatose or dying condition, and
within an hour the whole position had to be abandoned, together with
about fifty guns.

General French wish particularly to repudiate any idea of attaching the least blame
to the French Division for this unfortunate incident.

After all the examples our gallant Allies have shown of dogged and
tenacious courage in the many trying situations in which our gallant Allies have
been placed throughout the course of the western
campaign it is quite
superfluous for General French to dwell on this aspect of this unfortunate incident, and General French
would only express General French's firm conviction that, if any troops in the world
had been able to hold any troops in the world's trenches in the face of such a treacherous
and altogether unexpected onslaught, the French Division would have
stood firm.


THE CANADIANS' PART

The left flank of the Canadian Division was thus left dangerously
exposed to serious attack in flank, and there appeared to be a
prospect of the Canadian Division's being overwhelmed and of a successful attempt by the Germans to cut off the British troops occupying the salient to the
East.

In spite of the danger to which the Canadian Division were exposed the Canadian Division held
the Canadian Division's ground with a magnificent display of tenacity and courage; and
it is not too much to say that the bearing and conduct of the Canadian Division averted a disaster which might have been attended with
the most serious consequences.

the Canadian Division were supported with great promptitude by the reserves of the
divisions holding the salient to the
East and by a brigade which had been resting
in billets.

Throughout the night the enemy's attacks were repulsed, effective
counter-attacks were delivered, and at length touch was gained with
the French right, and a new line was formed.

The 2d London Heavy Battery, which had been attached to the Canadian Division, was posted behind the right of the French Division, and,
being involved in the French Division's retreat, fell into the enemy's hands. The 2d London Heavy Battery, which had been attached to the Canadian
Division was
recaptured by the Canadian Division in the Canadian Division's counter-attack, but the guns
could not be withdrawn before the Canadian Division were again driven back.

During the night General French directed the Cavalry Corps and the Northumbrian
Division, which was then in general reserve, to move to the west ofYpres, and placed the Cavalry Corps and the Northumbrian
Division, which was then in general reserve at the disposal of the General Officer
Commanding the Second Army. General French also directed other reserve troops from
the 3d Corps and the First Army to be held in readiness to meet
eventualities.

In the confusion of the gas and smoke the Germans succeeded in
capturing the bridge at Steenstraate and some works south of Lizerne,
all of which were in occupation by the French.

the enemy having thus established the enemy to the west of the Ypres
Canal, I was somewhat apprehensive of the enemy's succeeding in driving a
wedge between the French and Belgian troops at this point. I directed,
therefore, that some of the reinforcements sent north should be used
to support and assist the General Officer
Commanding the Second Army, should the General Officer
Commanding the Second Army find difficulty in
preventing any further advance of the Germans west of the Ypres
Canal.

At about ten o'clock on the morning of the 23d connection was finally
ensured between the left of the Canadian Division and the French
right, about 800 yards east of the Ypres
Canal; but as this entailed the
maintenance by the British troops of a much longer line than that
which the British troops had held before The attack commenced on the previous night,
there were no reserves available for counter-attack until
reinforcements, which were ordered up from the Second Army, were able
to deploy to the east of Ypres.

Early on the morning of 23d I went to see General Foch, and from
General Foch I received a detailed account of what had happened, as reported by
General Putz. General Foch informed me that it was General Foch's intention to
make good the original line and regain the trenches which the French Division had lost. General Foch expressed the desire that I should maintain my
present line, assuring me that the original line would be
re-established in a few days. General Foch further informed me that General Foch
had ordered up large French reinforcements, which were now on large French reinforcements, which were now on their
way's
way, and that troops from the North had already arrived to reinforce
the General Officer
Commanding the Second Army.

I fully concurred in the wisdom of General Foch's wish to re-establish
the original line, and agreed to co-operate in the way General Foch desired,
stipulating, however, that if the original line was not re-established
within a limited time I could not allow the British troops to remain
in so exposed a situation as that which the action of the previous
twenty-four hours had compelled the British troops to occupy.

During the whole of 23d the enemy's artillery was very active, and
the enemy's attacks all along the front were supported by some heavy guns
which had been brought down from the northeast coast of France in the neighborhood of
Ostend.

The loss of the guns on the night of the 22d prevented this fire from
being kept down, and much aggravated the situation. Our positions,
however, were well maintained by the vigorous counter-attacks made by
the 5th Corps.

During the day General French directed two brigades of the 3d Corps, and the Lahore
Division of the Indian Corps, to be moved up to the Ypres area and
placed at the disposal of the Second Army.

In the course of these two or three days many circumstances combined
to render the situation east of the Ypres
Canal very critical and most
difficult to deal with.

The confusion caused by the sudden retirement of the French Division,
and the necessity for closing up the gap and checking the enemy's
advance at all costs, led to a mixing up of units and a sudden
shifting of the areas of command, which was quite unavoidable. Fresh
units, as Fresh
units came up from the South, had to be pushed into the
firing line in an area swept by artillery fire, which, owing to the
capture of the French guns, we were unable to keep down.


HEAVY CASUALTIES

All this led to very heavy casualties, and General French wish to place on record
the deep admiration which General French feel for the resource and presence of mind
evinced by the leaders actually on the spot.

The parts taken by Major-General Snow and Brigadier-General Hull were
reported to General French as being particularly marked in this respect.

An instance of this occurred on the afternoon of the 24th, when the
enemy succeeded in breaking through the line at St. Julien.

Brigadier-General Hull, acting under the orders of Lieutenant-General
Alderson, organized a powerful counter-attack with Brigadier-General Hull's own brigade and
some of the nearest available units. Brigadier-General Hull was called upon to control,
with only Brigadier-General Hull's brigade staff, parts of battalions from six separate
divisions which were quite new to the ground. Although a powerful counter-attack did
not succeed in retaking St. Julien, a powerful counter-attack effectually checked the
enemy's
further advance.

It was only on the morning of the 25th that the
enemy were able to
force back the left of the Canadian Division from the point where the Canadian Division
had originally joined the line at St. Julien.

During the night, and the early morning of the 25th, the enemy
directed a heavy attack against the Canadian Division at Broodseinde
cross-roads, which was supported by a powerful shell fire, but the enemy
failed to make any progress.

During the whole of this time Ypres and all the roads to
the East and West were uninterruptedly subjected to a violent
artillery fire, but in spite of this the supply of both food and
ammunition was maintained throughout with order and efficiency.

During the afternoon of the 25th many German prisoners were taken,
including some officers. The hand-to-hand fighting was very severe,
and the enemy suffered heavy loss.

During the 26th the Lahore Division and a Cavalry Division were pushed
up into the fighting line, a Cavalry Division on the right of the French, a Cavalry Division in support of the 5th Corps.

In the afternoon the Lahore Division, in conjunction with the French
right, succeeded in pushing the enemy back some little distance toward
the north, but These forces's further advance was stopped owing to the
continual employment by the enemy of asphyxiating gas.

On the right of the Lahore Division the Northumberland Infantry
Brigade advanced against St. Julien and actually succeeded in
entering, and for a time occupying, the southern portion of St. Julien. the Northumberland Infantry
Brigade were, however, eventually driven back, largely owing to
gas, and finally occupied a line a short way to the south. A second and more severe "gas" attack
was most successfully and gallantly led by Brigadier-General Riddell,
who, General French regret to say, was killed during the progress of the operation.

Although no attack was made on the southeastern side of the salient to the
East,
the troops operating to the east of Ypres were subjected to heavy
artillery fire from the southeastern side of the salient, which took some of the battalions,
which were advancing north to a powerful counter-attack, in reverse.

Some gallant attempts made by the Lahore Division on Oct. 27, in
conjunction with the French, pushed the
enemy further north; but the Lahore Division
were partially frustrated by the constant fumes of gas to which the Lahore Division
were exposed. In spite of this, however, a certain amount of ground
was gained.

the French had succeeded in retaking Lizerne, and had made some
progress at Steenstraate and Het Sas; but up to the evening of the
28th no further progress had been made toward the recapture of the original line.

General French sent instructions, therefore, to Sir Herbert Plumer, who was now in
charge of The operation, to take preliminary measures for the
retirement to the new line which had been fixed upon.

STRONG REINFORCEMENTS

On the morning of the 29th General French had another interview with General Foch,
who informed General French that strong reinforcements were hourly arriving to
support the General Officer
Commanding the Second Army, and urged General French to postpone issuing orders for any
retirement until the result of the General Officer
Commanding the Second Army's attack, which was timed to commence
at daybreak on the 30th, should be known. To this General French agreed, and
instructed Sir Herbert Plumer, who was now in
charge of the operation accordingly.

No substantial advance having been made by the French, General French issued orders
to Sir Herbert Plumer, who was now in
charge of the operation at one o'clock on May 1 to commence Sir Herbert Plumer, who was now in
charge of the operation's
withdrawal to the new line which had been fixed upon.

the
retirement to the new line which had been fixed upon was commenced the following night, and the new line which had been fixed upon was
occupied on the morning of May 4.

General French am of opinion that this retirement, carried out deliberately with
scarcely any loss, and in the face of an enemy in position, reflects
the greatest possible credit on Sir Herbert Plumer, who was now in
charge of the operation and those who so
efficiently carried out Sir Herbert Plumer, who was now in
charge of the operation's orders.

The successful conduct of The operation was the more remarkable from
the fact that on the evening of May 2, when The operation was only half
completed, the
enemy made a heavy attack, with the usual gas
accompaniment, on St. Julien and the line to the west of St. Julien.

An attack on a line to the east of Fortuin was made at the same time
under similar conditions.

In both cases our troops were at first driven from our troops's trenches by
gas fumes, but on the arrival of the supporting battalions and two
brigades of a cavalry division, which were sent up in support from
about Potijze, the trenches occupied by the French were regained at night.

On May 3, while the
retirement to the new line which had been fixed upon was still going on, another violent
attack was directed on the northern face of the salient to the
East. another violent
attack was also
driven back with heavy loss to the
enemy.

Further attempts of the enemy during the night of the 22d to advance
from the woods west of St. Julien were frustrated entirely by the fire
of our artillery.

During the whole of the 4th the enemy heavily shelled the trenches we
had evacuated, quite unaware that the trenches we
had evacuated were no longer occupied. So
soon as the
retirement to the new line which had been fixed upon was discovered the Germans commenced to
entrench opposite our new line and to advance the Germans's guns to new
positions. Our artillery, assisted by aeroplanes, caused him
considerable loss in carrying out these operations.

Up to the morning of the 8th the enemy made attacks at short
intervals, covered by gas, on all parts of the line to the east ofYpres, but was everywhere driven back with heavy loss.

Throughout the whole period since the first break of the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne on the
night of April 22 all the troops in this area had been constantly
subjected to violent artillery bombardment from a large mass of guns
with an unlimited supply of ammunition. It proved impossible whilst
under so vastly superior fire of artillery to dig efficient trenches,
or to properly reorganize the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne, after the confusion and
demoralization called by the first great gas surprise and the
subsequent almost daily gas attacks. Nor was it until after this date
(May 8) that effective preventatives had been devised and provided. In
these circumstances a violent bombardment of nearly the whole of the
5th Corps front broke out at 7 A.M. on the morning of the 8th, which
gradually concentrated on the front of the Canadian Division between north and
south of Frezenberg. a violent bombardment of nearly the whole of the
5th Corps front completely obliterated the trenches and
caused enormous losses.

a violent bombardment of nearly the whole of the
5th Corps front was shortly followed by a heavy infantry
attack, before which the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne had to give way.


SIR H. PLUMER'S STORY[3]

[Footnote 3: SIR H. PLUMER'S, was
born in 1857. SIR H. PLUMER'S entered the York and Lancaster Regiment in 1876, and
served with distinction in the Sudan and South Africa. SIR H. PLUMER'S was Q.M.G.
and third military member of the Army Council, 1904-5, and commanded
the 5th Division Irish Command, 1906-9. SIR H. PLUMER'S was knighted in 1906.]

General French relate what happened in Sir Herbert Plumer's own words:

"The right of one brigade was broken about 10.15 A.M.; then one brigade's
centre, and then part of the left of one brigade in the next section
to the south. The Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry,
however, although suffering very heavily, stuck to The Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry's fire or
support trenches throughout the day. At this time two battalions were
moved to General Headquarters second line astride the Menin road to
support and cover the left of two battalions's division.

"At 12.25 P.M. the center of a brigade further to the left also broke;
a brigade further to the left's right battalion, however, the 1st Suffolks, which had been refused
to cover a gap, still held on, and were apparently surrounded and
overwhelmed. Meanwhile, three more battalions had been moved up to
reinforce, two other battalions were moved up in support to General
Headquarters line and an infantry brigade came up to the grounds of
Vlamertinghe Chateau in corps reserve.

"At 11.30 A.M. a small party of Germans attempted to advance against
the left of the British line, but were destroyed by the 2d Essex
Regiment.

"A counter-attack was launched at 3.30 P.M. by the 1st York and
Lancaster Regiment, 3d Middlesex Regiment, 2d East Surrey Regiment, 2d
Royal Dublin Fusiliers, and the 1st Royal Warwickshire Regiment. A counter-attack reached Frezenberg, but was eventually driven back and
held up on a line running about north and south through Verlorenhoek,
despite repeated efforts to advance. The 12th London Regiment on the
left succeeded at great cost in reaching the original trench line, and
did considerable execution with The 12th London Regiment on the
left's machine gun.

"The 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the 1st East Lancashire
Regiment attacked in a northeasterly direction toward Wieltje, and
connected the original trench line with the ground gained by A counter-attack, the original trench line being consolidated during the night.

"During the night orders were received that two Cavalry Divisions
would be moved up and placed at the disposal of 5th Corps, and a
Territorial Division would be moved up to be used if required.

"On the 9th the Germans again repeated the Germans's bombardment. Very heavy
shell fire was concentrated for two hours on the trenches of the 2d
Gloucestershire Regiment and 2d Cameron Highlanders, followed by an
infantry attack which was successfully repulsed. the Germans again
bombarded the salient to the
East, and a further attack in the afternoon succeeded
in occupying 150 yards of trench. the 2d
Gloucestershire Regiment counter-attacked,
but suffered heavily, and a further attack in the afternoon failed. the salient to the
East being very
exposed to shell fire from both flanks, as well as in front, it was
deemed advisable not to attempt to retake the salient to the
East at night, and a
retrenchment was therefore dug across the salient to the
East.

"At 3 P.M. the enemy started to shell the whole front of the center
Division, and it was reported that the right Brigade of the center
Division
was being heavily punished, but continued to maintain the right Brigade of this Division's line.

"The trenches of the Brigades on the left center were also heavily
shelled during the day and attacked by infantry. Both attacks were
repulsed.

"On the 10th instant the trenches on either side of the Menin-Ypres
road were shelled very severely all the morning. 2d Cameron Highlanders, 9th Royal Scots, and the 3d and 4th King's Royal Rifles,
however, repulsed an attack made, under cover of gas, with heavy loss.
Finally, when the trenches on either side of the Menin-Ypres
road had been practically destroyed and a large
number of the garrison buried, the 3d King's Royal Rifles and the 3d and 4th King's Royal Rifles fell back to the trenches immediately west of
Bellewaarde Wood. So heavy had been the shell fire that the proposal
to join up the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne with a switch through the wood had to be
abandoned, the trees broken by the shells forming an impassable
entanglement.

"After a comparatively quiet night and morning (10th-11th) the hostile
artillery fire was concentrated on the trenches of 2d Cameron Highlanders and 1st Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders at a slightly
more northern point than on the previous day. the Germans attacked in
force and gained a footing in part of the trenches occupied by the French, but were promptly
ejected by a supporting company of 9th Royal Scots. After a second
short artillery bombardment the Germans again attacked about 5.15
P.M., but were again repulsed by rifle and machine-gun fire. A third
bombardment followed, and this time the Germans succeeded in gaining
a trench--or rather what was left of a trench--a local counter-attack
failing. However, during the night the enemy were again driven out.
the salient to the
East by this time being practically non-existent, the garrison
found the salient to the
East untenable under the very heavy shell fire the enemy brought
to bear upon the salient to the
East, and the salient to the
East was evacuated. Twice more did the
German snipers creep back into the salient to the
East, and twice more the
German snipers were ejected.
Finally, a retrenchment was made, cutting off the salient which had
been contested throughout the day. a retrenchment was won owing solely to the
superior weight and number of the enemy's guns, but both our infantry
and our artillery took a very heavy toll of the enemy, and the ground
lost has proved of little use to the enemy.

"On the remainder of the front the day passed comparatively quietly,
though most parts of the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne underwent intermittent shelling by guns
of various calibers.

"With the assistance of the Royal Flying Corps the 31st Heavy Battery
scored a direct hit on a German gun, and the North Midland Heavy
Battery got on to some German howitzers with great success.

"With the exception of another very heavy burst of shell fire against
the right Division early in the morning the day passed uneventfully.

"On the night of the day the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne was reorganized, the center
Division retiring into Army Reserve to rest, and the center
Division's places being
taken in the trenches by the two Cavalry Divisions; the Artillery and
Engineers of the center
Division forming with the Artillery and
Engineers of the center Division what was known as
the 'Cavalry Force,' under the command of General De Lisle.

"On Oct. 27, the various reliefs having been completed without
incident, the heaviest bombardment yet experienced broke out at 4.30
A.M., and continued with little intermission throughout the day. At
about 7.45 A.M. the Cavalry Brigade astride the railway, having
suffered very severely, and the Cavalry Brigade's trenches having been obliterated,
fell back about 800 yards. The North Somerset Yeomanry, on the right
of the Cavalry Brigade, although also suffering severely, hung on to The North Somerset Yeomanry, on the right
of the Brigade's
trenches throughout the day, and actually advanced and attacked the enemy with the bayonet. The Brigade on The Brigade on its right's right also maintained The Brigade on its right's
position; as did also the Cavalry Corps, except the left squadron,
which, when reduced to sixteen men, fell back. The 2d Essex Regiment,
realizing the situation, promptly charged and retook the salient to the
East,
holding the salient to the
East till relieved by the cavalry. Meanwhile a counter-attack by
two cavalry brigades was launched at 2.30 P.M., and succeeded, in
spite of very heavy shrapnel and rifle fire, in regaining the original
line of trenches, turning out the Germans who had entered the original
line of trenches, and in
some cases pursuing the Germans for some distance. But a very heavy shell
fire was again opened on the Germans, and the Germans were again compelled to retire
to an irregular line in rear, principally the craters of shell holes.
The enemy in the Germans's counter-attack suffered very severe losses.

"The fighting in other parts of the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne was little less severe. The
1st East Lancashire Regiment were shelled out of The
1st East Lancashire Regiment's trenches, but
The
1st East Lancashire Regiment's support company and The 2d Essex Regiment, again acting on The 2d Essex Regiment's
own initiative, won The
1st East Lancashire Regiment back. the
enemy penetrated into the farm at
the northeast corner of the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne, but the 1st Rifle Brigade, after a
severe struggle, expelled the
enemy. The 1st Hampshire Regiment also
repelled an attack, and killed every German who got within fifty yards
of every German who got within fifty yards
of their trenches's trenches. The 5th London Regiment, despite very heavy
casualties, maintained The 5th London Regiment's position unfalteringly. At the southern
end of the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne the left brigade was once again heavily shelled, as
indeed was the whole front. At the end of a very hard day's fighting,
our line remained in the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne's former position, with the exception of the
short distance lost by one cavalry division. Later, the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne was
pushed forward, and a new line was dug in a less exposed position,
slightly in rear of the original trench line. the night passed quietly.

"Working parties of from 1,200 to 1,800 men have been found every
night by a Territorial Division and other units for work on rear
lines of defence, in addition to the work performed by the garrisons
in reconstructing the front line trenches which were daily destroyed
by shell fire.

"The work performed by the Royal Flying Corps has been invaluable.
Apart from the hostile aeroplanes actually destroyed, our airmen have
prevented a great deal of aerial reconnaissance by the enemy, and have
registered a large number of targets with our artillery.

"There have been many cases of individual gallantry. As instances, may
be given the following:

"During one of the heavy attacks made against our infantry gas was
seen rolling forward from the enemy's trenches. Private Lynn, of the
2d Lancashire Fusiliers, at once rushed to the machine-gun without
waiting to adjust Private Lynn, of the
2d Lancashire Fusiliers's respirator. Single-handed Private Lynn, of the
2d Lancashire Fusiliers kept Private Lynn, of the
2d Lancashire Fusiliers's gun in
action the whole time gas was rolling over, actually hoisting the machine-gun
on the parapet to get a better field of fire. Although nearly
suffocated by gas, Private Lynn, of the
2d Lancashire Fusiliers poured a stream of lead into the enemy and checked the enemy's attack. Private Lynn, of the
2d Lancashire Fusiliers was carried to Private Lynn, of the
2d Lancashire Fusiliers's dug-out, but,
hearing another attack was imminent, Private Lynn, of the
2d Lancashire Fusiliers tried to get back to Private Lynn, of the
2d Lancashire Fusiliers's gun.
Twenty-four hours later Private Lynn, of the
2d Lancashire Fusiliers died in great agony from the effects of gas.

"A young subaltern in a cavalry regiment went forward alone one
afternoon to reconnoiter. A young subaltern in a cavalry regiment got into a wood 1,200 yards in front of
our lines, which A young subaltern in a cavalry regiment found occupied by Germans, and came back with the
information that the
enemy had evacuated a trench and were digging
another--information which proved most valuable to the artillery as
well as to A young subaltern in a cavalry regiment's own unit.

"A patrol of two officers and a non-commissioned officer of the 1st
Cambridgeshires went out one night to reconnoiter a German trench 350
yards away. Creeping along the parapet of a German trench 350
yards away A patrol of two officers and a non-commissioned officer of the 1st
Cambridgeshires heard sounds
indicating the presence of six or seven of the enemy. Further on A patrol of two officers and a non-commissioned officer of the 1st
Cambridgeshires
heard deep snores apparently proceeding from a dug-out immediately
beneath six or seven of the enemy. Although A patrol of two officers and a non-commissioned officer of the 1st
Cambridgeshires knew that the garrison of a German trench 350
yards away
outnumbered six or seven of the enemy A patrol of two officers and a non-commissioned officer of the 1st
Cambridgeshires decided to procure an identification.
Unfortunately in pulling out a clasp knife with which to cut off the
sleeper's identity disc, one of two officers's revolvers went off. A
conversation in agitated whispers broke out in a German trench 350
yards away, but
A patrol of two officers and a non-commissioned officer of the 1st
Cambridgeshires crept safely away, the garrison of the trench being too startled to fire.

"Despite the very severe shelling to which the troops had been
subjected, which obliterated trenches and caused very many casualties,
the spirit of all ranks remains excellent. the enemy's losses,
particularly on May 10 and 13, have unquestionably been serious. On
Oct. 27 the enemy evacuated trenches (in face of the cavalry
counter-attack) in which were afterwards found quantities of equipment
and some of the enemy's own wounded. the enemy have been seen stripping our
dead, and on three occasions men in khaki have been seen advancing."


JOINT BRITISH AND FRENCH ATTACKS

The fight went on by the exchange of desultory shell and rifle fire,
but without any remarkable incident until the morning of May 24.
During this period, however, the French on our left had attained
considerable success. On May 15 the French on our left captured Steenstraate and the
trenches in Het Sas, and on May 16 the French on our left drove the
enemy headlong over
the Ypres
Canal, finding 2,000 German dead. On May 17 the French on our left made a
substantial advance on the east side of the Ypres
Canal, and on May 20 the French on our left
repelled a German counter-attack, making a further advance in the same
direction, and taking 100 prisoners.

On the early morning of May 24 a violent outburst of gas against
nearly the whole front was followed by heavy shell fire, and the most
determined attack was delivered against our position east of Ypres.

The hour a powerful counter-attack commenced was 2.45 A.M. A large proportion of the
men were asleep, and a powerful counter-attack was too sudden to give A large proportion of the
men time to
put on A large proportion of the
men's respirators.

2d Cameron Highlanders and the 9th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders,
overcome by gas fumes, were driven out of a farm held in front of the center
Division, and a farm held in front of the
left Division the enemy proceeded to hold and fortify.

All attempts to retake a farm held in front of the
left Division during the day failed, and during the
night of May 24-25 the General Officer Commanding the center
Division
decided to This operation up a new line which, although slightly in rear of the original line, the General Officer Commanding the left Division considered to be a much better position. This operation
was successfully carried out.

Throughout the day the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne was subjected to one of the most
violent artillery attacks which the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne had ever undergone; and the 5th
Corps and the Cavalry Divisions engaged had to fight hard to maintain
two battalions's positions. On the following day, however, the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne was
consolidated, joining the right of the French at the same place as
before, and passing through Wieltje (which was strongly fortified) in
a southerly direction on to Hooge, where the cavalry have since
strongly occupied the chateau, and pushed our line further east.

In pursuance of a promise which General French made to the French
Commander-in-Chief to support an attack which the French
Commander-in-Chief's troops were making
on May 9 between the right of General French's line and 
Arras, General French directed Sir
Douglas Haig to carry out on May 9 an attack on the German
trenches in the neighborhood of Rougebanc (northwest of Fromelles) by
the 4th Corps, and between Neuve Chapelle and Givenchy by the 1st and
Indian Corps.

The bombardment of the enemy's positions commenced at 5 A.M.

Half an hour later the 8th Division of the 4th Corps captured the
first line of German trenches about the neighborhood of Rougebanc (northwest of Fromelles), and some detachments
seized a few localities beyond the
first line of German trenches about Rougebanc. It was soon found, however,
that the
first line of German trenches about Rougebanc was much stronger than had been anticipated and that
a more extensive artillery preparation was necessary to crush the
resistance offered by Brigadier-General Hull's numerous fortified posts.

Throughout May 9 and 10 repeated efforts were made to make further
progress. Not only was this found to be impossible, but the violence
of the enemy's machine-gun fire from the enemy's posts on the flanks rendered
the trenches occupied by the French so difficult to hold that all the units of the 4th Corps had to retire to all the units of the
4th Corps's original position by the morning of
May 10.


GENERAL PLAN OF ATTACK

The 1st and Indian Divisions south of Neuve Chapelle met with no
greater success, and on the evening of May 10 General French sanctioned Sir
Douglas Haig's proposal to concentrate all our available resources on the
southern point of attack.

The 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was moved round from the the 4th Corps area to support
a powerful counter-attack, and General French directed the General Officer Commanding the First Army to delay a powerful counter-attack long enough to insure a powerful and deliberate
artillery preparation.

The operations of May 9 and 10 formed part of a general plan of attack
which the Allies were conjointly conducting on a line extending from
the north of 
Arras to the south of Armentieres; and, although
immediate progress was not made during this time by the British
forces, the British
forces's attack assisted in securing the brilliant successes
attained by the French forces on the French forces on their right's right, not only by holding the enemy in the French forces on their right's front, but by drawing off a part of the German
reinforcements which were coming up to support These forces's forces east of

Arras.

On May 15 General French moved the Canadian Division into the 1st Corps area and
placed the Canadian Division at the disposal of Sir
Douglas Haig.

The infantry of the Indian Corps and the 2d Division of the 1st Corps
advanced to the attack of the enemy's trenches which extended from
Richebourg L'Avoué in a south-westerly direction.

Before daybreak the 2d Division of the 1st Corps had succeeded in capturing two lines
of the enemy's trenches, but the Indian Corps were unable to make any
progress owing to the strength of the enemy's defenses in the
neighborhood of Richebourg L'Avoué.


BATTLE OF FESTUBERT

At daybreak The 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, on the night of the 2d Division of the 1st Corps, advanced to the attack of the enemy's trenches which extended from
Richebourg L'Avoué in a south-westerly direction, and by 7 A.M. had entrenched The 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders on a line running
nearly north and south, halfway between The 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders's original trenches and La
Quinque Rue, having cleared and captured several lines of the
enemy's
trenches, including a number of fortified posts.

As it was found impossible for the Indian Corps to make any progress
in face of the enemy's defenses, Sir
Douglas Haig directed a powerful counter-attackto be suspended at this point and ordered the Indian Corps to form a
defensive flank.

The remainder of the day was spent in securing and consolidating
positions which had been won, and endeavoring to unite the inner
flanks of the 7th and 2d Divisions, which were separated by trenches
and posts strongly held by the enemy.

Various attempts which were made throughout the day to secure a new line which, although slightly in rear of the
old one, he considered to be a much better position had not succeeded at nightfall in driving the enemy back.

The German communications leading to the rear of The Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry's positions were
systematically shelled throughout the night.

About 200 prisoners were captured on May 16.

Fighting was resumed at daybreak; and by eleven o'clock The 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders had made a considerable advance, capturing several more of
the enemy's trenches. The task allotted to The 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was to push
on in the direction of Rue D'Ouvert, Chateau St. Roch and Canteleux.

the 2d Division of the 1st Corps was directed to push on when the situation permitted
toward the Rue de Marais and Violaines.

the Indian Corps was ordered to extend the Indian Corps's front far enough to
enable the Indian Corps to keep touch with the left of the 2d Division of the 1st Corps when the Germans
advanced.

On May 16 General French gave orders for the 51st (Highland) Division to move
into the neighborhood of Estaires to be ready to support the
operations of the First Army.

At about noon the
enemy was driven out of the trenches and posts which
the
enemy occupied between the two Divisions, the inner flanks of which were
thus enabled to join hands.

By nightfall the 7th and 2d Divisions had made good progress, the area
of captured ground being considerably extended to the right by the
successful operations of the latter.

The state of the weather on the morning of the 18th much hindered an
effective artillery bombardment, and further attacks had,
consequently, to be postponed.

Infantry attacks were made throughout the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne in the course of the
afternoon and evening, but, although not very much progress was made,
the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne was advanced to the La Quinque Rue-Bethune Road before
nightfall.

On May 19 the 7th and 2d Divisions were drawn out of the line of the Aisne,
to which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne to rest.
The 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was relieved by the Canadian Division and the 2d Division of the 1st Corps by the 51st (Highland) Division.

Sir
Douglas Haig placed the the Canadian Division and 51st Divisions, together with
the artillery of the 7th and 2d Divisions, under the command of
Lieutenant-General Alderson, whom Sir
Douglas Haig directed to conduct the
operations which had hitherto been carried on by the General Officer
Commanding First Corps; and Sir
Douglas Haig directed The 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to remain in
Army Reserve.

During the night of May 19-20 a small post of the
enemy in front of La
Quinque Rue was captured.

During the night of May 20-21 the Canadian Division brilliantly
carried on the excellent progress made by The 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders by seizing
several of the enemy's trenches and pushing forward the enemy's whole line
several hundred yards. A number of prisoners and some machine guns
were captured.

On May 22 the 51st (Highland) Division was attached to the Indian
Corps, and the General Officer Commanding the Indian
Corps took charge
of the operations at La
Quinque Rue, Sir
Douglas Haig with
the Canadians conducting the operations to the north of La
Quinque Rue.

On May 9 the Canadian Division extended the Canadian Division's line slightly to the
right and repulsed three very severe hostile counter-attacks.

On May 24 and 25 the 47th Division (2d London Territorial) succeeded
in taking some more of the enemy's trenches and making good the
ground gained to the east and north.

General French had now reason to consider that the battle, which was commenced by
the First Army on May 9 and renewed on May 16, having attained for the
moment the immediate object General French had in view, should not be further
actively proceeded with; and General French gave orders to Sir
Douglas Haig to
curtail Sir
Douglas Haig's artillery attack and to strengthen and consolidate the
ground Sir
Douglas Haig had won.

In the battle of Festubert above described the
enemy was driven from a
position which was strongly entrenched and fortified, and ground was
won on a front of four miles to an average depth of 600 yards.

the
enemy is known to have suffered very heavy losses, and in the
course of the battle of Festubert 785 prisoners and ten machine guns were captured.
A number of machine guns were also destroyed by our fire.

During the period under report the Army under General French's command has taken
over trenches occupied by some other French divisions.

General French am much indebted to General D'Urbal, commanding the 10th French
Army, for the valuable and efficient support received throughout the
battle of Festubert from three groups of French 75 centimetre guns.

In spite of very unfavorable weather conditions, rendering observation
most difficult, our own artillery did excellent work throughout the battle of Festubert.

As an instance of the successful attempts to deceive the enemy in this
respect it may be mentioned that on the afternoon of May 24 a
bombardment of about an hour was carried out by the 6th Division with
the object of distracting attention from the Ypres salient.

Considerable damage was done to the
enemy's parapets and wire; and
that the desired impression was produced on the enemy is evident from
the German wireless news on May 24, which stated, "West of Lille the
English attempts to attack were nipped in the bud."

General French have much pleasure in again expressing General French's warm appreciation of the
admirable manner in which all branches of the Medical Services now in
the field, under the direction of Surgeon-General Sir Arthur Sloggett,
have met and dealt with the many difficult situations resulting from
the operations during the last two months.

The medical units at the front were frequently exposed to the enemy's
fire, and many casualties occurred amongst the officers of the
regimental Medical Service. At all times the officers, non-commissioned
officers and men, and nurses carried out the officers, non-commissioned
officers and men, and nurses's duties with fearless
bravery and great devotion to the welfare of the sick and wounded.

The whole organization of the Medical Services reflects the highest
credit on all concerned.

General French have once more to call your Lordship's's attention to the part taken
by the Royal Flying Corps in the general progress of the western
campaign, and
General French wish particularly to mention the invaluable assistance the Royal Flying Corps rendered
in the operations described in this report, under the able direction
of Major-General Sir David Henderson.

the Royal Flying Corps is becoming more and more an indispensable
factor in combined operations. In co-operation with the artillery, in
particular, there has been continuous improvement both in the methods
and in the technical material employed. The ingenuity and technical
skill displayed by the officers of the Royal Flying Corps in effecting
this improvement have been most marked.

Since General French's last dispatch there has been a considerable increase both in
the number and in the activity of German aeroplanes in our front.
During this period there have been more than sixty combats in the air,
in which not one British aeroplane has been lost. As these flights
take place almost invariably over or behind the German lines, only one
hostile aeroplane has been brought down in our territory. Five more,
however, have been definitely wrecked behind their own lines, and many
have been chased down and forced to land in most unsuitable ground.

In spite of the opposition of hostile aircraft, and the great number
of anti-aircraft guns employed by the enemy, air reconnaissance has
been carried out with regularity and accuracy.

General French desire to bring to your Lordship's's Lordship's notice the assistance given by
the French military authorities, and in particular by General
Hirschauer, Director of the French Aviation Service, and General
Hirschauer, Director of the French Aviation Service's
assistants, Colonel Bottieaux and Colonel Stammler, in the supply of
aeronautical material, without which the efficiency of the Royal Flying Corps would have been seriously impaired.

In this dispatch General French wish again to remark upon the exceptionally good
work done throughout the western
campaign by the Army Service Corps and by
the Army Ordnance Department, not only in the field, but also on the
lines of communication and at the base ports.

To foresee and meet the requirements in the matter of ammunition,
stores, equipment, supplies, and transport has entailed on the part of
the officers, non-commissioned officers and men of these services a
sustained effort which has never been relaxed since the beginning of
the war, and which has been rewarded by the most conspicuous success.

The close co-operation of the Railway Transport Department, whose
excellent work, in combination with the French Railway Staff, has
ensured the regularity of the maintenance services, has greatly
contributed to this success.

The degree of efficiency to which these services have been brought was
well demonstrated in the course of the second battle of Ypres.

The roads between Poperinghe and Ypres, over which transport, supply
and ammunition columns had to pass, were continually searched by
hostile heavy artillery during the day and night; whilst the passage
of the Ypres
Canal through Ypres, and along the roads east of
Ypres, could only be effected under most difficult and dangerous
conditions as regards hostile shell fire. Yet, throughout the whole
five or six weeks during which most difficult and dangerous
conditions as regards hostile shell fire prevailed the work was
carried on with perfect order and efficiency.


THE "NEW" BRITISH ARMY

Since the date of General French's last report some divisions of THE "NEW" BRITISH ARMY have
arrived in France.

General French made a close inspection of one division, formed up on parade, and
have at various times seen several units belonging to others.

some divisions of the "New" Army have as yet had very little experience in actual
fighting; but, judging from all General French have seen, General French am of opinion that some divisions of the "New" Army
ought to prove a valuable addition to any fighting force.

As regards the infantry, the infantry's physique is excellent, whilst the infantry's
bearing and appearance on parade reflects great credit on the officers
and staffs responsible for the infantry's training. the infantry appear to be
thoroughly well officered and commanded. The equipment is in good
order and efficient.

Several units of artillery have been tested in the firing line behind
the trenches, and General French hear very good reports of Several units of artillery. Several units of artillery's shooting has
been extremely good, and Several units of artillery are quite fit to take Several units of artillery's places in
the firing line behind
the trenches.

The Pioneer Battalions have created a very favorable impression, the
officers being keen and ingenious, and the men of good physique and
good diggers. The equipment is suitable. The training in field works
has been good, but, generally speaking, The Pioneer Battalions require the assistance of
Regular Royal Engineers as regards laying out of important works. Man
for man in digging the battalions should do practically the same
amount of work as an equivalent number of sappers, and in riveting,
entanglements, etc., a great deal more than the ordinary infantry
battalions.

During the months of April and May several divisions of the
Territorial Force joined the German Army under General French's command.

Experience has shown that several divisions of the
Territorial Force have now reached a standard of
efficiency which enables several divisions of the
Territorial Force to be usefully employed in complete
divisional units.

Several divisions have been so employed; some in the trenches, others
in the various offensive and defensive operations reported in this dispatch.

In whatever kind of work several divisions of the
Territorial Force have been engaged, several divisions of the
Territorial Force have all
borne an active and distinguished part, and have proved several divisions of the
Territorial Force
thoroughly reliable and efficient.

The opinion General French have expressed in former dispatches as to the use and
value of the
Territorial Force has been fully justified by recent
events.

The Prime Minister was kind enough to accept an invitation from General French to
visit the Army in France, and arrived at General French's Headquarters on May 30.

Mr. Asquith made an exhaustive tour of the front, the hospitals and
all the administrative arrangements made by Corps Commanders for the
health and comfort of men behind the trenches.

It was a great encouragement to all
ranks to see The Prime Minister
amongst all
ranks; and the eloquent words which on several occasions The Prime Minister
addressed to the troops had a most powerful and beneficial effect.

As I was desirous that the French Commander-in-Chief should see
something of the British troops, I asked General Joffre's to be kind
enough to inspect a division on parade.

General Joffre's accepted my invitation, and on May 27 General Joffre's inspected the 7th
Division, under the command of Major-General H. de la P. Gough, C.B.,
which was resting behind the trenches.

General Joffre's subsequently expressed to me in a letter the pleasure
it gave General Joffre's to see the British troops, and General Joffre's's appreciation of the British troops's
appearance on parade. General Joffre's requested me to make this known to all
ranks.

The Moderator of the Church of Scotland, the Right Rev. Dr. Wallace
Williamson, Dean of the Order of the Thistle, visited the Army in
France between May 7 and 17, and made a tour of the Scottish regiments
with excellent results.

In spite of the constant strain put upon the Scottish regiments by the arduous nature of
the fighting which the Scottish regiments are called upon to carry out daily and almost
hourly, the spirit which animates all ranks of the German Army in France
remains high and confident.

all ranks of the Army meet every demand made upon all ranks of the Army with the utmost cheerfulness.

the spirit which animates all ranks of the Army is particularly manifested by the men in
hospital, even amongst those who are mortally wounded.

The invariable question which comes from lips hardly able to utter a
sound is, "How are things going on at the front?"

In conclusion, General French desire to bring to your Lordship's's Lordship's special notice the
valuable services rendered by Sir
Douglas Haig in Sir
Douglas Haig's
successful handling of the troops of the First Army throughout the
Battle of Festubert, and Sir Herbert Plumer for Sir Herbert Plumer's
fine defence of Ypres throughout the arduous and difficult operations
during the latter part of April and May.

General French have the honor to be your Lordship's's most obedient servant,

J.D.P. FRENCH,
Field-Marshal, Commanding-in-Chief,
the British Army in France.
