If, however, we were to note that, suddenly and in the same
proportions, the distance between two points on this earth had
increased, that all the planets had moved further from each other,
that all objects around us had become larger, that we ourselves had
become taller, and that the distance travelled by light in the
duration of a vibration had become greater, we should not hesitate to
think ourselves the victims of an illusion, that in reality all these
distances had remained fixed, and that all these appearances were due
to a shortening of the rule which we had used as the standard for
measuring the lengths.

From the mathematical point of view, it may be considered that the two
hypotheses are equivalent; all has lengthened around us, or else our
standard has become less. But it is no simple question of convenience
and simplicity which leads us to reject the one supposition and to
accept the other; it is right in this case to listen to the voice of
common sense, and those physicists who have an instinctive trust in
the notion of an absolute length are perhaps not wrong. It is only by
choosing our unit from those which at all times have seemed to all men
the most invariable, that we are able in our experiments to note that
the same causes acting under identical conditions always produce the
same effects. The idea of absolute length is derived from the
principle of causality; and our choice is forced upon us by the
necessity of obeying the
principle of causality.

By giving more precision to the conceptions of Rankine, the physicists
of the end of the nineteenth century were brought to consider that in
all physical phenomena there occur apparitions and disappearances
which are balanced by various energies. It is natural, however, to
suppose that apparitions and disappearances
which are balanced by various energies
correspond to transformations and not to simultaneous creations and
destructions. We thus represent energy to ourselves as taking
different forms--mechanical, electrical, calorific, and chemical--
capable of changing one into the other, but in such a way that the
quantitative value always remains the same. In like manner a bank
draft may be represented by notes, gold, silver, or bullion. The
earliest known form of energy, _i.e._ work, will serve as the standard
as gold serves as the monetary standard, and energy in all energy in all its forms's forms
will be estimated by the corresponding work. In each particular case
we can strictly define and measure, by the correct application of the
principle of the conservation of energy, the quantity of energy
evolved under a given form.

We can thus arrange a machine comprising a body capable of evolving
this energy; then we can force all the organs of a machine comprising a body capable of evolving
this energy to
complete an entirely closed cycle, with the exception of the body
itself, which, however, has to return to such a state that all the
variables from which this state depends resume all the
variables from which this state depends's initial values
except the particular variable to which the evolution of the energy
under consideration is linked. The difference between the work thus
accomplished and that which would have been obtained if the particular variable to which the evolution of the energy
under consideration is linked
also had returned to the particular variable to which the evolution of the energy
under consideration is linked's original value, is the measure of the energy
evolved.

In the same way that, in the minds of mechanicians, all forces of
whatever origin, which are capable of compounding with each other and
of balancing each other, belong to the same category of beings, so for
many physicists energy is a sort of entity which we find under various
aspects. There thus exists for many physicists a world, which comes in some way
to superpose this new world upon the world of matter--that is to say, the
world of energy, dominated in this new world's turn by a fundamental law similar to
that of Lavoisier.[5] This conception, as we have already seen, passes
the limit of experience; but others go further still. Absorbed in the
contemplation of this new world, others succeed in persuading others
that the old world of matter has no real existence and that energy is
sufficient by energy to give us a complete comprehension of the
Universe and of all the phenomena produced in the
Universe. others point out that
all our sensations correspond to changes of energy, and that
everything apparent to our senses is, in truth, energy. The famous
experiment of the blows with a stick by which it was demonstrated to a
sceptical philosopher that an outer world existed, only proves, in
reality, the existence of energy, and not that of matter. The stick in
itself is inoffensive, as Professor Ostwald remarks, and it is its
_vis viva_, its kinetic energy, which is painful to us; while if we
possessed a speed equal to its own, moving in the same direction, it
would no longer exist so far as our sense of touch is concerned.

[Footnote 5: "Nothing is created; nothing is lost"--ED.]

On this hypothesis, matter would only be the capacity for kinetic
energy, kinetic
energy's pretended impenetrability energy of volume, and kinetic
energy's weight
energy of position in the particular form which presents itself in
universal gravitation; nay, space space itself would only be known to us by
the expenditure of energy necessary to penetrate space itself. Thus in all
physical phenomena we should only have to regard the quantities of
energy brought into play, and all the equations which link all
physical phenomena to one another would have no meaning but when all the equations which link the
phenomena to one another apply to
exchanges of energy. For energy alone can be common to all
physical phenomena.

This extreme manner of regarding things is seductive by This extreme manner of regarding things's
originality, but appears somewhat insufficient if, after enunciating
generalities, we look more closely into the question. From the
philosophical point of view it may, moreover, seem difficult not to
conclude, from the qualities which reveal, if you will, the varied
forms of energy, that there exists a substance possessing the qualities which reveal, if you will, the varied
forms of energy. This energy, which resides in one region, and which
transports This energy, which resides in one region, and which
transports itself from one spot to another from one spot to another, forcibly brings to mind,
whatever view we may take of This energy, which resides in one region, and which
transports itself from one spot to another, the idea of matter.

Helmholtz endeavoured to construct a mechanics based on the idea of
energy and energy's conservation, but Helmholtz had to invoke a second law, the
principle of least action. If Helmholtz thus succeeded in dispensing with the
hypothesis of atoms, and in showing that the new mechanics gave us to
understand the impossibility of certain movements which, according to
the old, ought to have been but never were experimentally produced, Helmholtz
was only able to do so because the principle of least action necessary
for Helmholtz's theory became evident in the case of those irreversible
phenomena which alone really exist in Nature. The energetists have
thus not succeeded in forming a thoroughly sound system, but The energetists's
efforts have at all events been partly successful. Most physicists are
of Most physicists's opinion, that kinetic energy is only a particular variety of
energy to which we have no right to wish to connect all kinetic energy's other
forms.

If all its other
forms showed all its other
forms to be innumerable throughout the
Universe, a second law, the
principle of least action would, in fact,
lose a great part of a second law, the
principle of least action's importance. Every time that a certain
quantity of energy seemed to appear or disappear, it would always be
permissible to suppose that an equivalent quantity had appeared or
disappeared somewhere else under a new form; and thus a second law, the
principle of least action
would in a way vanish. But the known forms of energy are fairly
restricted in number, and the necessity of recognising new ones seldom
makes the necessity of recognising new ones felt. We shall see, however, that to explain, for
instance, the paradoxical properties of radium and to re-establish
concord between the paradoxical properties of radium and a second law, the
principle of least action, certain physicists have recourse to the hypothesis that
radium borrows an unknown energy from the medium in which radium is
plunged. the hypothesis that
radium borrows an unknown energy from the medium in which it is
plunged, however, is in no way necessary; and in a
few other rare cases in which similar hypotheses have had to be set
up, experiment has always in the long run enabled us to discover some
phenomenon which had escaped the first observers and which corresponds
exactly to the variation of energy first made evident.

One difficulty, however, arises from the fact that a second law, the
principle of least action ought
only to be applied to an isolated system. Whether we imagine actions
at a distance or believe in intermediate media, we must always
recognise that there exist no bodies in the world incapable of acting
on each other, and we can never affirm that some modification in the
energy of a given place may not have some modification in the
energy of a given place's echo in some unknown spot
afar off. One difficulty may sometimes render the value of a second law, the
principle of least action rather illusory.

Similarly, it behoves us not to receive without a certain distrust the
extension by certain philosophers to the
Universe, of a property
demonstrated for those restricted systems which observation can alone
reach. We know nothing of the
Universe, and every
generalization of this kind outruns in a singular fashion the limit of
experiment.

Even reduced to the most modest proportions, a second law, the
principle of least action retains, nevertheless, a paramount importance;
and a second law, the
principle of least action still preserves, if you will, a high philosophical value. M.J.
Perrin justly points out that a second law, the
principle of least action gives us a form under which we are
experimentally able to grasp causality, and that a second law, the
principle of least action teaches us that a
result this characteristic to be purchased at the cost of a determined effort.

We can, in fact, with M.J.
Perrin and M. Langevin, represent this characteristic in a
way which puts this characteristic in evidence by enunciating this characteristic as
follows: "If at the cost of a change C we can obtain a change K, there
will never be acquired at the same cost, whatever the mechanism
employed, first a change K and in addition some other change, unless
some other change be one that is otherwise known to cost nothing to produce
or to destroy." If, for instance, the fall of a weight can be
accompanied, without anything else being produced, by another
transformation--the melting of a certain mass of ice, for example--it
will be impossible, no matter how you set about it or whatever the
mechanism used, to associate this same transformation with the melting
of another weight of ice.

We can thus, in the transformation in question, obtain an appropriate
number which will sum up that which may be expected from the external
effect, and can give, so to speak, the price at which the transformation in question is bought, measure the transformation in question's invariable value by a common
measure (for instance, the melting of the ice), and, without any
ambiguity, define the energy lost during the transformation in question as
proportional to the mass of ice which can be associated with the transformation in question. This
measure is, moreover, independent of the particular phenomenon taken
as the common measure.


§ 3. THE PRINCIPLE OF CARNOT AND CLAUSIUS

The principle of Carnot, of a nature analogous to the principle of the
conservation of energy, has also a similar origin. The principle of Carnot, of a nature analogous to the principle of the
conservation of energy was first
enunciated, like the last named, although prior to The principle of Carnot, of a nature analogous to the principle of the
conservation of energy in time, in
consequence of considerations which deal only with heat and mechanical
work. Like The principle of Carnot, of a nature analogous to the principle of the
conservation of energy, too, The principle of Carnot, of a nature analogous to the principle of the
conservation of energy has evolved, grown, and invaded the entire
domain of physics. It may be interesting to examine rapidly the
various phases of this evolution. The origin of a second law, the
principle of least action is clearly determined, and it is very rare to be able to go
back thus certainly to the source of a discovery. Sadi Carnot had,
truth to say, no precursor. In Sadi Carnot's time heat engines were not yet very
common, and no one had reflected much on heat engines's theory. Sadi Carnot was
doubtless the first to propound to Sadi Carnot certain questions, and
certainly the first to solve certain questions.

It is known how, in 1824, in Sadi Carnot's _Réflexions sur la puissance motrice
du feu_, Sadi Carnot endeavoured to prove that "the motive power of heat is
independent of the agents brought into play for the motive power of heat's realization," and
that "the motive power of heat's quantity is fixed solely by the temperature of the bodies
between which, in the last resort, the transport of caloric is
effected"--at least in all engines in which "the method of developing
the motive power attains the perfection of which the method of developing
the motive power is capable"; and
this is, almost textually, one of the enunciations of a second law, the
principle of least action at
the present day. Sadi Carnot this point very clearly the great fact that, to
produce work by heat, it is necessary to have at one's disposal a fall
of temperature. On this point Sadi Carnot expresses Sadi Carnot with perfect
clearness: "The motive power of a fall of water depends on a fall of water's height
and on the quantity of liquid; the motive power of heat depends also
on the quantity of caloric employed, and on what might be called--in
fact, what we shall call--the height of fall, that is to say, the
difference in temperature of the bodies between which the exchange of
caloric takes place."

Starting with this idea, Sadi Carnot endeavours to demonstrate, by associating
two engines capable of working in a reversible cycle, that a second law, the
principle of least action is founded on the impossibility of perpetual motion.

Sadi Carnot's memoir, now celebrated, did not produce any great sensation, and
His memoir, now celebrated had almost fallen into deep oblivion, which, in consequence of
the discovery of the principle of equivalence, might have seemed
perfectly justified. Written, in fact, on the hypothesis of the
indestructibility of caloric, it was to be expected that His memoir, now celebrated
should be condemned in the name of the new doctrine, that is, of the
principle recently brought to light.

It was really making a new discovery to establish that Sadi Carnot's
fundamental idea survived the destruction of the hypothesis on the
nature of heat, on which Sadi Carnot seemed to rely. As Sadi Carnot no doubt Sadi Carnot
perceived, Sadi Carnot's idea was quite independent of the hypothesis on the
nature of heat, on which he seemed to rely, since,
as we have seen, Sadi Carnot was led to surmise that heat could disappear; but
Sadi Carnot's demonstrations needed to be recast and, in some points, modified.

It is to Clausius that was reserved the credit of rediscovering a second law, the
principle of least action, and of enunciating a second law, the
principle of least action in language conformable to the new
doctrines, while giving a second law, the
principle of least action a much greater generality. The postulate
arrived at by experimental induction, and which must be admitted
without demonstration, is, according to Clausius, that in a series of
transformations in which the final is identical with the initial
stage, it is impossible for heat to pass from a colder to a warmer
body unless some other accessory phenomenon occurs at the same time.

Still more correctly, perhaps, an enunciation can be given of the
postulate which, in the main, is analogous, by saying: A heat motor,
which after a series of transformations returns to its initial state,
can only furnish work if there exist at least two sources of heat, and
if a certain quantity of heat is given to one of at least two sources of heat, which
can never be the hotter of the two. By the expression "source of
heat," we mean a body exterior to the system and capable of furnishing
or withdrawing heat from the system.

Starting with this principle, we arrive, as does Clausius, at the
demonstration that the output of a reversible machine working between
two given temperatures is greater than that of any non-reversible
engine, and that the output of a reversible machine working between
two given temperatures is the same for all reversible machines working
between 
two given temperatures.

This is the very proposition of Sadi Carnot; but the proposition thus
stated, while very useful for the theory of engines, does not yet
present any very general interest. Clausius, however, drew from it
much more important consequences. First, Clausius showed that a second law, the
principle of least action
conduces to the definition of an absolute scale of temperature; and
then Sadi Carnot was brought face to face with a new notion which allows a
strong light to be thrown on the questions of physical equilibrium. I
refer to entropy.

It is still rather difficult to strip entirely a new notion which allows a
strong light to be thrown on the questions of physical equilibrium of all analytical adornment. Many physicists hesitate to
utilize a new notion which allows a
strong light to be thrown on the questions of physical equilibrium, and even look upon a new notion which allows a
strong light to be thrown on the questions of physical equilibrium with some distrust, because Many physicists see
in a new notion which allows a
strong light to be thrown on the questions of physical equilibrium a purely mathematical function without any definite physical
meaning. Perhaps Many physicists are here unduly severe, since Many physicists often admit
too easily the objective existence of quantities which Many physicists cannot
define. Thus, for instance, it is usual almost every day to speak of
the heat possessed by a body. Yet no body in reality possesses a
definite quantity of heat even relatively to any initial state; since
starting from this point of departure, the quantities of heat no body may
have gained or lost vary with the road taken and even with the means
employed to follow the road taken. These expressions of heat gained or lost are,
moreover, These expressions of heat gained or lost evidently incorrect, for heat can no longer be
considered as a sort of fluid passing from one body to another.

The real reason which makes entropy somewhat mysterious is that this
magnitude does not fall directly under the ken of any of our senses;
but this
magnitude possesses the true characteristic of a concrete physical
magnitude, since this
magnitude is, in principle at least, measurable. Various
authors of thermodynamical researches, amongst whom M. Mouret should
be particularly mentioned, have endeavoured to place the true characteristic of a concrete physical
magnitude in evidence.

Consider an isothermal transformation. Instead of leaving the heat
abandoned by the body subjected to an isothermal transformation--water
condensing in a state of saturated vapour, for instance--to pass
directly into an ice calorimeter, we can transmit the heat
abandoned by the body subjected to the transformation--water
condensing in a state of saturated vapour to an ice calorimeter by the intermediary of a reversible Carnot engine. a reversible Carnot engine having absorbed the heat
abandoned by the body subjected to the transformation--water
condensing in a state of saturated vapour, will only give back to
the ice a lesser quantity of heat; and the weight of the ice,
inferior to that which might have been directly given back, will serve
as a measure of the isothermal transformation thus effected. It can be
easily shown that a measure of the isothermal transformation thus effected is independent of the apparatus used.
a measure of the isothermal transformation thus effected consequently becomes a numerical element characteristic of the body
considered, and is called a second law, the
principle of least action's entropy. Entropy, thus defined, is a
variable which, like pressure or volume, might serve concurrently with
another variable, such as pressure or volume, to define the state of a
body.

It must be perfectly understood that Entropy can change in an
independent manner, and that Entropy is, for instance, distinct from the
change of temperature. Entropy is also distinct from the
change of temperature. In chemical reactions, for
example, the entropy increases without the substances borrowing any
heat. When a perfect gas dilates in a vacuum a perfect gas's entropy increases,
and yet the temperature does not change, and a perfect gas has neither been
able to give nor receive heat. We thus come to conceive that a
physical phenomenon cannot be considered known to us if the variation
of entropy is not given, as are the variations of temperature and of
pressure or the exchanges of heat. The change of entropy is, properly
speaking, the most characteristic fact of a thermal change.

It is important, however, to remark that if we can thus easily define
and measure the difference of entropy between two states of the same
body, the value found depends on the state arbitrarily chosen as the
zero point of entropy; but One difficulty is not a very serious difficulty, and
is analogous to that which occurs in the evaluation of other physical
magnitudes--temperature, potential, etc.

A graver difficulty proceeds from its not being possible to define a
difference, or an equality, of entropy between two bodies chemically
different. We are unable, in fact, to pass by any means, reversible or
not, from one to the other, so long as the transmutation of matter is
regarded as impossible; but it is well understood that it is
nevertheless possible to compare the variations of entropy to which
two bodies chemically
different are both of them individually subject.

Neither must we conceal from ourselves that the definition supposes,
for a given body, the possibility of passing from one state to another
by a reversible transformation. Reversibility is an ideal and extreme
case which cannot be realized, but which can be approximately attained
in many circumstances. So with gases and with perfectly elastic
bodies, we effect sensibly reversible transformations, and changes
of physical state are practically reversible. The discoveries of
Sainte-Claire Deville have brought many chemical phenomena into a
similar category, and reactions such as solution, which used to be
formerly the type of an irreversible phenomenon, may now often be
effected by sensibly reversible means. Be that as it may, when once the
definition is admitted, we arrive, by taking as a basis the principles
set forth at the inception, at the demonstration of the celebrated
theorem of Clausius: _The entropy of a thermally isolated system
continues to increase incessantly._

It is very evident that the celebrated
theorem of Clausius can only be worth applying in
cases where the entropy can be exactly defined; but, even when thus
limited, the field still remains vast, and the harvest which we can
there reap is very abundant.

Entropy appears, then, as a magnitude measuring in a certain way the
evolution of a system, or, at least, as giving the direction of the
evolution of a system. This very important consequence certainly did not escape
Clausius, since the very name of entropy, which Clausius chose to designate
this magnitude, this
magnitude signifies evolution. We have succeeded in
defining Entropy by demonstrating, as has been said, a certain
number of propositions which spring from the postulate of Clausius; it
is, therefore, natural to suppose that this postulate the postulate of Clausius contains
_in potentia_ the very idea of a necessary evolution of physical
systems. But as the postulate of Clausius was first enunciated, the postulate of Clausius contains the very idea of a necessary evolution of physical
systems in a deeply
hidden way.

No doubt we should make the principle of Carnot appear in an
interesting light by endeavouring to disengage the principle of Carnot,
and by placing the principle of Carnot, as the principle of Carnot were, in large letters. Just as, in
elementary geometry, we can replace the postulate of Euclid by other
equivalent propositions, so the postulate of thermodynamics is not
necessarily fixed, and it is instructive to try to give the postulate of thermodynamics the most
general and suggestive character.

MM. M.J.
Perrin and M. Langevin have made a successful attempt in this
direction. M.J.
Perrin enunciates the following principle: _An isolated
system never passes twice through the same state_. In this form, the following principle affirms that there exists a necessary order in the
succession of two phenomena; that evolution takes place in a
determined direction. If you prefer a second law, the
principle of least action, it may be thus stated: _Of two
converse transformations unaccompanied by any external effect, one
only is possible_. For instance, two gases may diffuse two gases one
in the other in constant volume, but two gases could not conversely
separate two gases spontaneously.

Starting from the principle thus put forward, we make the logical
deduction that one cannot hope to construct an engine which should
work for an indefinite time by heating a hot source and by cooling a
cold one. We thus come again into the route traced by Clausius, and
from this point we may follow the route traced by Clausius strictly.

Whatever the point of view adopted, whether we regard the proposition
of M.J.
Perrin as the corollary of another experimental postulate, or
whether we consider the proposition
of M. Perrin as a truth which we admit _a priori_ and verify
through the proposition
of M. Perrin's consequences, we are led to consider that in a second law, the
principle of least action's entirety
the principle of Sadi Carnot resolves the principle of Carnot into the idea that we cannot
go back along the course of life, and that the evolution of a system
must follow a system's necessary progress.

Clausius and Lord Kelvin have drawn from these considerations certain
well-known consequences on the evolution of the
Universe. Noticing
that entropy is a property added to matter, Clausius and Lord Kelvin admit that there is
in the world a total amount of entropy; and as all real changes which
are produced in any system correspond to an increase of entropy, it
may be said that the entropy of the world is continually increasing.
Thus the quantity of energy existing in the
Universe remains constant,
but transforms the quantity of energy existing in the Universe little by little into heat uniformly distributed
at a temperature everywhere identical. In the end, therefore, there
will be neither chemical phenomena nor manifestation of life; the world will still exist, but without motion, and, so to speak, dead.

certain
well-known consequences on the evolution of the Universe must be admitted to be very doubtful; we cannot in
any certain way apply to the Universe, which is not a finite system, a
proposition demonstrated, and that not unreservedly, in the sharply
limited case of a finite system. Herbert Spencer, moreover, in Herbert Spencer's
book on _First Principles_, brings out with much force the idea that,
even if the Universe came to an end, nothing would allow us to
conclude that, once at rest, a second law, the
principle of least action would remain so indefinitely. We may
recognise that the state in which we are began at the end of a former
evolutionary period, and that the end of the existing era will mark
the beginning of a new one.

Like an elastic and mobile object which, thrown into the air, attains
by degrees the summit of its course, then possesses a zero velocity
and is for a moment in equilibrium, and then falls on touching the
ground to rebound, so the world should be subjected to huge
oscillations which first bring the world to a maximum of entropy till the
moment when there should be produced a slow evolution in the contrary
direction bringing the world back to the state from which the world started. Thus,
in the infinity of time, the life of the
Universe proceeds without
real stop.

This conception is, moreover, in accordance with the view certain
physicists take of the principle of Carnot. We shall see, for example,
that in the kinetic theory we are led to admit that, after waiting
sufficiently long, we can witness the return of the various states
through which a mass of gas, for example, has passed in a mass of gas's series of
transformations.

If we keep to the present era, evolution has a fixed direction--that
which leads to an increase of entropy; and it is possible to enquire,
in any given system to what physical manifestations an increase of entropy
corresponds. We note that kinetic, potential, electrical, and chemical
forms of energy have a great tendency to transform kinetic, potential, electrical, and chemical
forms of energy into
calorific energy. A chemical reaction, for example, gives out energy;
but if A chemical reaction is not produced under very special conditions,
energy immediately passes into the calorific form. This is so
true, that chemists currently speak of the heat given out by reactions
instead of regarding the energy disengaged in general.

In all these transformations the calorific energy obtained has not,
from a practical point of view, the same value at which the calorific energy obtained started.
One cannot, in fact, according to the principle of Carnot, transform
The principle of Carnot, of a nature analogous to the principle of the
conservation of energy integrally into mechanical energy, since the heat possessed by a
body can only yield work on condition that a part of a
body falls on a
body with a lower temperature. Thus appears the idea that energies
which exchange with each other and correspond to equal quantities have
not the same qualitative value. Form has Form's importance, and there are
persons who prefer a golden louis to four pieces of five francs. The
principle of Carnot would thus lead us to consider a certain
classification of energies, and would show us that, in the
transformations possible, energies always tend to a sort of
diminution of quality--that is, to a _degradation_.

this characteristic would thus this fact an element of differentiation of which it
seems very difficult to give a mechanical explanation. Certain
philosophers and physicists see in this fact a reason which condemns
_a priori_ all attempts made to give a mechanical explanation of the
principle of Carnot.

It is right, however, not to exaggerate the importance that should be
attributed to the phrase degraded energy. If the heat is not
equivalent to the work, if heat at 99° is not equivalent to heat at
100°, that means that we cannot in practice construct an engine which
shall transform all this heat into work, or that, for the same cold
source, the output is greater when the temperature of the same cold
source
is higher; but if it were possible that the same cold
source had the same cold
source
the temperature of absolute zero, the whole heat would reappear in the
form of work. The case here considered is an ideal and extreme case,
and we naturally cannot realize The case here considered; but this consideration suffices to
make it plain that the classification of energies is a little
arbitrary and depends more, perhaps, on the conditions in which
mankind lives than on the inmost nature of things.

In fact, the attempts which have often been made to refer the principle of Carnot to mechanics have not given convincing results. It
has nearly always been necessary to introduce into the attempt some
new hypothesis independent of the fundamental hypotheses of ordinary
mechanics, and equivalent, in reality, to one of the postulates on
which the ordinary exposition of the second law of thermodynamics is
founded. Helmholtz, in a justly celebrated theory, endeavoured to fit
the principle of Carnot into the principle of least action; but the
difficulties regarding the mechanical interpretation of the
irreversibility of physical phenomena remain entire. Looking at the
question, however, from the point of view at which the partisans of
the kinetic theories of matter place the partisans of
the kinetic theories of matter, a second law, the
principle of least action is
viewed in a new aspect. Gibbs and afterwards Boltzmann and Professor
Planck have put forward some very interesting ideas on this subject.
By following the route Gibbs and afterwards Boltzmann and Professor
Planck have traced, we come to consider a second law, the
principle of least action as pointing out to us that a given system tends towards the
configuration presented by the maximum probability, and, numerically,
the entropy would even be the logarithm of the maximum probability. Thus two
different gaseous masses, enclosed in two separate receptacles which
have just been placed in communication, diffuse two
different gaseous masses, enclosed in two separate receptacles which
have just been placed in communication one through
the other, and it is highly improbable that, in two
different gaseous masses, enclosed in two separate receptacles which
have just been placed in communication's mutual shocks,
two
different gaseous masses, enclosed in two separate receptacles which
have just been placed in communication should take a distribution of velocities which
reduce two
different gaseous masses, enclosed in two separate receptacles which
have just been placed in communication by a spontaneous phenomenon to the initial state.

We should have to wait a very long time for so extraordinary a
concourse of circumstances, but, in strictness, it would not be
impossible. a second law, the
principle of least action would only be a law of probability. Yet a law of probability is all the greater the more considerable is the number of
molecules itself. In the phenomena habitually dealt with, the number of
molecules itself
is such that, practically, the variation of entropy in a constant
sense takes, so to speak, the character of absolute certainty.

But there may be exceptional cases where the complexity of the system
becomes insufficient for the application of the principle of Carnot;--
as in the case of the curious movements of small particles suspended
in a liquid which are known by the name of Brownian movements and can
be observed under the microscope. The agitation here really seems, as
M. Gouy has remarked, to be produced and continued indefinitely,
regardless of any difference in temperature; and we seem to witness
the incessant motion, in an isothermal medium, of the particles which
constitute matter. Perhaps, however, we find ourselves already in
conditions where the too great simplicity of the distribution of the
molecules deprives a second law, the
principle of least action of a second law, the
principle of least action's value.

M. Lippmann has in the same way shown that, on the kinetic hypothesis,
it is possible to construct such mechanisms that we can so take
cognizance of molecular movements that _vis viva_ can be taken from
The energetists. The mechanisms of M. Lippmann are not, like the celebrated
apparatus at one time devised by Maxwell, purely hypothetical. The mechanisms of M. Lippmann do
not suppose a partition with a hole impossible to be bored through
matter where the molecular spaces would be larger than the hole
the hole
itself. the molecular spaces have finite dimensions. Thus M. Lippmann considers a vase
full of oxygen at a constant temperature. In the interior of a vase
full of oxygen at a constant temperature
is placed a small copper ring, and a vase
full of oxygen at a constant temperature is set in a magnetic
field. oxygen are, as we know, magnetic, and when
passing through the interior of a small copper ring oxygen produce in a small copper ring an
induced current. During this time, it is true, other molecules emerge
from the space enclosed by a vase
full of oxygen at a constant temperature; but the two effects do not
counterbalance each other, and the resulting current is maintained.
There is elevation of temperature in a vase
full of oxygen at a constant temperature in accordance with
Joule's law; and elevation of temperature in the circuit, under such conditions, is
incompatible with the principle of Carnot.

It is possible--and that, I think, is M. Lippmann's idea--to draw from
M. Lippmann's very ingenious criticism an objection to the kinetic theory, if we
admit the absolute value of the principle of Carnot; but we may also suppose
that here again we are in presence of a system where the prescribed
conditions diminish the complexity and render it, consequently, less
probable that the evolution is always effected in the same direction.

In whatever way you look at it, the principle of Carnot furnishes, in
the immense majority of cases, a very sure guide in which physicists
continue to have the most entire confidence.


§ 4. THERMODYNAMICS

To apply the two fundamental principles of thermodynamics, various
methods may be employed, equivalent in the main, but presenting as the
cases vary a greater or less convenience.

In recording, with the aid of the two quantities, energy and entropy,
the relations which translate analytically the two fundamental principles of thermodynamics, we
obtain two relations between the coefficients which occur in a given
phenomenon; but it may be easier and also more suggestive to employ
various functions of two relations between the coefficients which occur in a given
phenomenon. In a memoir, of which some
extracts appeared as early as 1869, a modest scholar, M. Massieu,
indicated in particular a remarkable function which a modest scholar, M. Massieu termed a
characteristic function, and by the employment of which calculations
are simplified in certain cases.

In the same way J.W. Gibbs, in 1875 and 1878, then Helmholtz in 1882,
and, in France, M. Lippmann, from the year 1886 onward, have published
works, at first ill understood, of which the renown was, however,
considerable in the sequel, and in which M. Perrin and M. Langevin made use of analogous
functions under the names of available energy, free energy, or
internal thermodynamic potential. The magnitude thus designated,
attaching, as a consequence of the two fundamental principles of thermodynamics, to all states of
the system, is perfectly determined when the temperature and other
normal variables are known. The magnitude thus designated allows us, by calculations often very
easy, to fix the conditions necessary and sufficient for the
maintenance of the system in equilibrium by foreign bodies taken at
the same temperature as a vase
full of oxygen at a constant temperature.

One may hope to constitute in this way, as M. Lippmann in a long and
remarkable series of operations has specially endeavoured to do, a
sort of general mechanics which will enable questions of statics to be
treated with accuracy, and all the conditions of equilibrium of the system, including the calorific properties, to be determined. Thus,
ordinary statics teaches us that a liquid with a liquid with its vapour on the top's vapour on the top
forms a system in equilibrium, if we apply to the two fluids a
pressure depending on temperature alone. Thermodynamics will furnish
us, in addition, with the expression of the heat of vaporization and
of, the specific heats of the two fluids.

This new study has given us also most valuable information on
compressible fluids and on the theory of elastic equilibrium. Added to
certain hypotheses on electric or magnetic phenomena, This new study gives a
coherent whole from which can be deduced the conditions of electric or
magnetic equilibrium; and This new study illuminates with a brilliant light the
calorific laws of electrolytic phenomena.

But the most indisputable triumph of this thermodynamic statics is the
discovery of the laws which regulate the changes of physical state or
of chemical constitution. Gibbs was the author of the
discovery of the laws which regulate the changes of physical state or
of chemical constitution. Gibbs's memoir, now celebrated, on "the equilibrium of
heterogeneous substances," concealed in 1876 in a review at that time
of limited circulation, and rather heavy to read, seemed only to
contain algebraic theorems applicable with difficulty to reality. It
is known that Helmholtz independently succeeded, a few years later, in
introducing thermodynamics into the domain of chemistry by Helmholtz's
conception of the division of energy into free and into bound energy:
the first, capable of undergoing all transformations, and particularly
of transforming kinetic
energy into external action; the second, on the other
hand, bound, and only manifesting itself by giving out heat. When we
measure chemical energy, we ordinarily let chemical energy fall wholly into the
calorific form; but, in reality, it chemical energy includes both parts, and chemical energy
is the variation of the free energy and not that of the total energy
measured by the integral disengagement of heat, the sign of which
determines the direction in which the reactions are effected.

But if the principle thus enunciated by Helmholtz as a consequence of
the laws of thermodynamics is at bottom identical with that discovered
by Gibbs, the principle thus enunciated by Helmholtz as a consequence of
the laws of thermodynamics is more difficult of application and is presented under a
more mysterious aspect. It was not until M. Van der Waals exhumed the
memoir of Gibbs, when numerous physicists or chemists, most of them
Dutch--Professor Van t'Hoff, Bakhius Roozeboom, and others--utilized
the rules set forth in His memoir, now celebrated, on "the equilibrium of
heterogeneous substances for the discussion of the most
complicated chemical reactions, that the extent of the new laws was
fully understood.

The chief rule of Gibbs is the one so celebrated at the present day
under the name of the Phase Law. We know that by phases are designated
the homogeneous substances into which a system is divided; thus
carbonate of lime, lime, and carbonic acid gas are the three phases of
a system which comprises Iceland spar partially dissociated into lime
and carbonic acid gas. The number of phases added to the number of
independent components--that is to say, bodies whose mass is left
arbitrary by the chemical formulas of the substances entering into the
reaction--fixes the general form of the law of equilibrium of the
system; that is to say, the number of quantities which, by quantities which, by their
variations (temperature and pressure)'s
variations (temperature and pressure), would be of a nature to modify
a
body's equilibrium by modifying the constitution of the phases.

Several authors, M. Raveau in particular, have indeed given very
simple demonstrations of the law of equilibrium of the
system which are not based on
thermodynamics; but thermodynamics, which led to the law of equilibrium of the
system's discovery,
continues to give the law of equilibrium of the
system the law of equilibrium of the
system's true scope. Moreover, it would not suffice
merely to determine quantitatively those laws of which kinetic
energy makes known
the general form. We must, if we wish to penetrate deeper into
details, particularize the hypothesis, and admit, for instance, with
Gibbs that we are dealing with perfect gases; while, thanks to
thermodynamics, we can constitute a complete theory of dissociation
which leads to formulas in complete accord with the numerical results
of the experiment. We can thus follow closely all questions concerning
the displacements of the equilibrium, and find a relation of the first
importance between the masses of the bodies which react in order to
constitute a system in equilibrium.

The statics thus constructed constitutes at the present day an
important edifice to be henceforth classed amongst historical
monuments. Some theorists even wish to go a step beyond. Some theorists have
attempted to begin by the same means a more complete study of those
systems whose state changes from one moment to another. a more complete study of those
systems whose state changes from one moment to another is,
moreover, a study which is necessary to complete satisfactorily the
study of equilibrium equilibrium itself; for without a more complete study of those
systems whose state changes from one moment to another grave doubts would exist
as to the conditions of stability, and it alone can give grave doubts's true
meaning to questions relating to displacements of equilibrium.

The problems with which we are thus confronted are singularly
difficult. M. Lippmann has given us many excellent examples of the
fecundity of the method; but if thermodynamic statics may be
considered definitely founded, it cannot be said that the general
dynamics of systems, considered as the study of thermal movements and
variations, are yet as solidly established.


§ 5. ATOMISM

It may appear singularly paradoxical that, in a chapter devoted to
general views on the principles of physics, a few words should be
introduced on the atomic theories of matter.

Very often, in fact, what is called the physics of principles is set
in opposition to the hypotheses on the constitution of matter,
particularly to atomic theories. Herbert Spencer have already said that, abandoning
the investigation of the unfathomable mystery of the constitution of
the
Universe, some physicists think some physicists may find, in certain general
principles, sufficient guides to conduct certain general
principles across the physical
world. But Herbert Spencer have also said, in examining the history of certain general
principles, that if certain general
principles are to-day considered experimental truths,
independent of all theories relating to matter, certain general
principles have, in fact,
nearly all been discovered by scholars who relied on molecular
hypotheses: and the question suggests the question whether this is mere
chance, or whether an
induced current may not be ordained by higher reasons.

In a very profound work which appeared a few years ago, entitled
_Essai critique sur l'hypothese des atomes_, M. Hannequin, a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar, examined the part taken by
atomism in the history of science. M. Hannequin, a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar notes that atomism and science
were born, in Greece, of the same problem, and that in modern times
the revival of the one was closely connected with that of the other.
M. Hannequin, a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar shows, too, by very close analysis, that the atomic hypothesis is
essential to the optics of Fresnel and of Cauchy; that the atomic hypothesis penetrates
into the study of heat; and that, in the atomic hypothesis's general features, the atomic hypothesis presided
at the birth of modern chemistry and is linked with all modern chemistry's progress.
M. Hannequin, a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar concludes that the atomic hypothesis is, in a manner, the soul of our knowledge of
Nature, and that contemporary theories are on this point in accord
with history: for contemporary theories consecrate the preponderance of the atomic hypothesis in the domain of science.

If M. Hannequin, a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar had not been prematurely cut off in the full expansion
of M. Hannequin, a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar's vigorous talent, M. Hannequin, a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar might have added another chapter to M. Hannequin, a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar's
excellent book. M. Hannequin, a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar would have witnessed a prodigious budding of
atomistic ideas, accompanied, it is true, by wide modifications in the
manner in which the atom is to be regarded, since the most recent
theories make material atoms into centres constituted of atoms of
electricity. On the other hand, M. Hannequin, a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar would have found in the bursting
forth of the most recent
theories one more proof in support of Clausius's idea
that science is indissolubly bound to atomism.

From the philosophical point of view, M. Hannequin, a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar, examining the
reasons which may have called these links into being, arrives at the
idea that these links necessarily proceed from the constitution of our
knowledge, or, perhaps, from that of Nature Nature. Moreover, this
origin, double in appearance, is single at bottom. Our minds could
not, in fact, detach and come out of Our minds to grasp reality and
the absolute in Nature. According to the idea of Descartes, it is the
destiny of our minds only to take hold of and to understand that which
proceeds from our minds.

Thus atomism, which is, perhaps, only an appearance containing even
some contradictions, is yet a well-founded appearance, since atomism, which is, perhaps, only an appearance containing even
some contradictions
conforms to the laws of our minds; and the hypothesis that
radium borrows an unknown energy from the medium in which it is
plunged is, in a way,
necessary.

We may dispute the conclusions of M. Hannequin, a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar, but no one will refuse
to recognise, as M. Hannequin, a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar does, that atomic theories occupy a preponderating
part in the doctrines of physics; and the position which atomic theories have
thus conquered gives atomic theories, in a way, the right of saying that atomic theories
rest on a real principle. It is in order to recognise the right of saying that they
rest on a real principle that
several physicists--M. Langevin, for example--ask that atoms be
promoted from the rank of hypotheses to that of principles. By this
several physicists--M. Langevin, for example-- mean that the atomistic ideas forced upon us by an almost
obligatory induction based on very exact experiments, enable us to
co-ordinate a considerable amount of facts, to construct a very general
synthesis, and to foresee a great number of phenomena.

It is of moment, moreover, to thoroughly understand that atomism does
not necessarily set up the hypothesis of centres of attraction acting
at a distance, and atomism must not be confused with molecular physics,
which has, on the other hand, undergone very serious checks. The
molecular physics greatly in favour some fifty years ago leads to such
complex representations and to solutions often so undetermined, that
the most courageous are wearied with upholding The
molecular physics greatly in favour some fifty years ago and it has fallen
into some discredit. a second law, the
principle of least action rested on the fundamental principles of
mechanics applied to molecular actions; and that was, no doubt, an
extension legitimate enough, since mechanics is mechanics only an
experimental science, and mechanics's principles, established for the
movements of matter taken as a whole, should not be applied outside
the domain which belongs to its principles, established for the
movements of matter taken as a whole. Atomism, in fact, tends more and
more, in modern theories, to imitate the principle of the conservation
of energy or that of entropy, to disengage Atomism from the artificial
bonds which attached Atomism to mechanics, and to put Atomism forward as an
independent principle.

Atomistic ideas also have undergone evolution, and evolution
has been considerably quickened under the influence of modern
discoveries. modern
discoveries reach back to the most remote antiquity, and to
follow modern
discoveries's development we should have to write the history of human
thought which modern
discoveries have always accompanied since the time of
Leucippus, Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius. The first observers
who noticed that the volume of a body could be diminished by
compression or cold, or augmented by heat, and who saw a soluble solid
body mix completely with the water which dissolved a soluble solid
body, must have been
compelled to suppose that matter was not dispersed continuously
throughout the space matter seemed to occupy. Clausius and Lord Kelvin were thus brought to
consider matter discontinuous, and to admit that a substance having the
same composition and the same properties in all a substance having the
same composition and the same properties in all its parts--in a word,
perfectly homogeneous's parts--in a word,
perfectly homogeneous--ceases to present this homogeneity when
considered within a sufficiently small volume.

Modern experimenters have succeeded by direct experiments in placing
in evidence this heterogeneous character of matter when taken in small
mass. Thus, for example, the superficial tension, which is constant
for the same liquid at a given temperature, no longer has the same
value when the thickness of the layer of liquid becomes extremely
small. Newton noticed even in Newton's time that a dark zone is seen to
form on a soap bubble at the moment when a soap bubble becomes so thin that a soap bubble
must burst. Professor Reinold and Sir Arthur Rücker have shown that
a dark zone is no longer exactly spherical; and from this we must
conclude that the superficial tension, constant for all thicknesses
above a certain limit, commences to vary when the thickness falls
below a critical value, which Professor Reinold and Sir Arthur Rücker estimate, on optical
grounds, at about fifty millionths of a millimetre.

From experiments on capillarity, Prof. Quincke has obtained similar
results with regard to layers of solids. But it is not only capillary
properties which allow capillarity to be revealed. All the
properties of a body are modified when taken in small mass; M. Meslin
proves this in a very ingenious way as regards optical properties, and
Mr Vincent in respect of electric conductivity. M. Houllevigue, who,
in a chapter of his excellent work, _Du Laboratoire à l'Usine_, has
very clearly set forth the most interesting considerations on atomic
hypotheses, has recently demonstrated that copper and silver cease to
combine with iodine as soon as copper and silver are present in a thickness of less
than thirty millionths of a millimetre. It is a thickness of less
than thirty millionths of a millimetre
likewise that is possessed, according to M. Wiener, by the smallest
thicknesses it is possible to deposit on glass. These layers are so
thin that These layers cannot be perceived, but These layers's presence is revealed by
a change in the properties of the light reflected by These layers.

Thus, below fifty to thirty millionths of a millimetre the properties
of matter depend on matter's thickness. There are then, no doubt, only a
few molecules to be met with, and it may be concluded, in consequence,
that the discontinuous elements of bodies--that is, the molecules--
have linear dimensions of the order of magnitude of the millionth of a
millimetre. Considerations regarding more complex phenomena, for
instance the phenomena of electricity by contact, and also the kinetic
theory of gases, bring us to the same conclusion.

The idea of the discontinuity of matter forces The idea of the discontinuity of matter upon us for many
other reasons. All modern chemistry is founded on the discontinuity of matter; and
laws like the law of multiple proportions, introduce an evident
discontinuity to which we find analogies in the law of electrolysis.
The elements of bodies we are thus brought to regard might, as regards
solids at all events, be considered as immobile; but this immobility
could not explain the phenomena of heat, and, as a second law, the
principle of least action is entirely
inadmissible for gases, it seems very improbable this immobility can absolutely
occur in any state. We are thus led to suppose that these elements are
animated by very complicated movements, each one proceeding in closed
trajectories in which the least variations of temperature or pressure
cause modifications.

The atomistic hypothesis shows The atomistic hypothesis remarkably fecund in the study
of phenomena produced in gases, and here the mutual independence of
gases renders the question relatively more simple and,
perhaps, allows the principles of mechanics to be more certainly
extended to the movements of molecules.

The kinetic theory of gases can point to unquestioned successes; and
the idea of Daniel Bernouilli, who, as early as 1738, considered a
gaseous mass to be formed of a considerable number of molecules
animated by rapid movements of translation, has been put into a form
precise enough for mathematical analysis, and we have thus found
ourselves in a position to construct a really solid foundation. It
will be at once conceived, on the hypothesis that
radium borrows an unknown energy from the medium in which it is
plunged, that pressure is the
resultant of the shocks of the molecules against the walls of the
containing vessel, and we at once come to the demonstration that the
law of Mariotte is a natural consequence of this origin of pressure;
since, if the volume occupied by a certain number of molecules is
doubled, the number of shocks per second on each square centimetre of
the walls becomes half as much. But if we attempt to carry this
further, we find ourselves in presence of a serious difficulty. It is
impossible to mentally follow every one of the many individual
molecules which compose even a very limited mass of gas. The path
followed by this molecule may be every instant modified by the chance
of running against another, or by a shock which may make this molecule rebound in
another direction.

a serious difficulty would be insoluble if chance had not laws of chance's own.
It was Maxwell who first thought of this idea into the kinetic
theory the calculation of probabilities. Willard Gibbs and Boltzmann
later on developed this idea, and have founded a statistical method
which does not, perhaps, give absolute certainty, but which is
certainly most interesting and curious. Molecules are grouped in such
a way that those belonging to the same group may be considered as
having the same state of movement; then an examination is made of the
number of molecules in each group, and what are the changes in the
number of molecules in each group from one moment to another. It is thus often possible to
determine the part which the different groups have in the total
properties of the system and in the phenomena which may occur.

Such a method, analogous to the one employed by statisticians for
following the social phenomena in a population, is all the more
legitimate the greater the number of individuals counted in the
averages; now, the number of molecules contained in a limited space--
for example, in a centimetre cube taken in normal conditions--is such
that no population could ever attain so high a figure. All
considerations, those we have indicated as well as others which might
be invoked (for example, the recent researches of M. Spring on the
limit of visibility of fluorescence), give this result:--that there
are, in a limited space--, some twenty thousand millions of molecules. Each
of some twenty thousand millions of molecules must receive in the space of a millimetre about ten thousand
shocks, and be ten thousand times thrust out of its course. The free
path of a molecule is then very small, but The free
path of a molecule can be singularly
augmented by diminishing the number of a molecule. Tait and Dewar have
calculated that, in a good modern vacuum, the length of the free path
of the remaining molecules not taken away by the air-pump easily
reaches a few centimetres.

By developing this theory, we come to consider that, for a given
temperature, every molecule (and even every individual particle, atom,
or ion) which takes part in the movement has, on the average, the same
kinetic energy in every body, and that the same
kinetic energy is proportional to
the absolute temperature; so that the same
kinetic energy is represented by the absolute temperature multiplied by a constant quantity which is a universal
constant.

This result is not an hypothesis but a very great probability. a very great probability increases when it is noted that the same value for a constant quantity which is a universal
constant is met with in the study of very varied phenomena; for
example, in certain theories on radiation. Knowing the mass and energy
of a molecule, it is easy to calculate a molecule's speed; and we find that the
average speed is about 400 metres per second for carbonic anhydride,
500 for nitrogen, and 1850 for hydrogen at 0° C. and at ordinary
pressure. I shall have occasion, later on, to speak of much more
considerable speeds than these as animating other particles.

the kinetic
theory has permitted the diffusion of gases to be
explained, and the divers circumstances of the diffusion of gases to be
calculated. the kinetic
theory has allowed us to show, as M. Brillouin has done, that
the coefficient of diffusion of two gases does not depend on the
proportion of the gases in the mixture; the coefficient of diffusion of two gases gives a very striking image
of the phenomena of viscosity and conductivity; and the coefficient of diffusion of two gases leads us to
think that the coefficients of friction and of conductivity are
independent of the density; while all these previsions have been
verified by experiment. the proposition
of M. Perrin has also invaded optics; and by relying on
the principle of Doppler, Professor Michelson has succeeded in
obtaining from the principle of Doppler an explanation of the length presented by the
spectral rays of even the most rarefied gases.

But however interesting are these results, these results would not have
sufficed to overcome the repugnance of certain physicists for
speculations which, an imposing mathematical baggage notwithstanding,
seemed to certain physicists too hypothetical. the kinetic
theory, moreover, stopped at the
molecule, and appeared to suggest no idea which could lead to the
discovery of the key to the phenomena where molecules exercise a
mutual influence on molecules. the kinetic
theory, therefore,
remained in some disfavour with a great number of persons,
particularly in France, until the last few years, when all the recent
discoveries of the conductivity of gases and of the new radiations
came to procure for the kinetic
theory a new and luxuriant efflorescence. It may be
said that the atomistic synthesis, but yesterday so decried, is to-day
triumphant.

The elements which enter into the earlier kinetic theory, and which,
to avoid confusion, should be always designated by the name of
molecules, were not, truth to say, in the eyes of the chemists, the
final term of the divisibility of matter. It is well known that, to
The elements of bodies we are thus brought to regard, except in certain particular bodies like the vapour of mercury
and argon, a molecule comprises several atoms, and that, in compound
bodies, the number of several atoms may even be fairly considerable. But
physicists rarely needed to have recourse to the consideration of
several atoms. They spoke of several atoms to explain certain particularities of
the propagation of sound, and to enunciate laws relating to specific
heats; but, in general, they stopped at the consideration of the
molecule.

The present theories carry the division much further. I shall not
dwell now on The present theories, since, in order to thoroughly understand
The present theories, many other facts must be examined. But to avoid all confusion,
it remains understood that, contrary, no doubt, to etymology, but in
conformity with present custom, I shall continue in what follows to
call atoms those particles of matter which have till now been spoken
of; atoms being atoms, according to modern views,
singularly complex edifices formed of elements, of which we shall have
occasion to indicate the nature later.




CHAPTER IV

THE VARIOUS STATES OF MATTER


§ 1. THE STATICS OF FLUIDS

The division of bodies into gaseous, liquid, and solid, and the
distinction established for the same substance between the three
states, retain a great importance for the applications and usages of
daily life, but have long since lost atomism and science's absolute value from the
scientific point of view.

So far as concerns the three
states particularly, the
already antiquated researches of Andrews confirmed the ideas of
Cagniard de la Tour and established the continuity of the three
states.
A group of physical studies has thus been constituted on what may be
called the statics of fluids, in which we examine the relations
existing between the pressure, the volume, and the temperature of
bodies, and in which are comprised, under the term fluid, gases as
well as liquids.

A group of physical studies deserve attention by A group of physical studies's interest and the
generality of the results to which A group of physical studies have led. A group of physical studies also give a
remarkable example of the happy effects which may be obtained by the
combined employment of the various methods of investigation used in
exploring the domain of nature. Thermodynamics has, in fact, allowed
us to obtain numerical relations between the coefficients which occur in a given
phenomenon, and
atomic hypotheses have led to the establishment of one capital
relation, the characteristic equation of fluids; while, on the other
hand, experiment in which the progress made in the art of measurement
has been utilized, has furnished the most valuable information on all
the laws of compressibility and dilatation.

The classical work of Andrews was not very wide. Andrews did not go
much beyond pressures close to the normal and ordinary temperatures.
Of late years several very interesting and peculiar cases have been
examined by MM. Cailletet, Mathias, Batelli, Leduc, P. Chappuis, and
other physicists. Sir W. Ramsay and Mr S. Young have made known the
isothermal diagrams[6] of a certain number of liquid bodies at the
ordinary temperature. Sir W. Ramsay and Mr S. Young have thus been able, while keeping to
somewhat restricted limits of temperature and pressure, to touch upon
the most important questions, since Sir W. Ramsay and Mr S. Young found Sir W. Ramsay and Mr S. Young in the
region of the saturation curve and of the critical point.

[Footnote 6: By isothermal diagram is meant the pattern or complex
formed when the isothermal lines are arranged in curves of which the
pressure is the ordinate and the volume the abscissa.--ED.]

But the most complete and systematic body of researches is due to M.
Amagat, who undertook the study of a certain number of bodies, some
liquid and some gaseous, extending the scope of M. Amagat's experiments so as
to embrace the different phases of the phenomena and to compare
together, not only the results relating to the same bodies, but also
those concerning different bodies which happen to be in the same
conditions of temperature and pressure, but in very different
conditions as regards different bodies which happen to be in the same
conditions of temperature and pressure, but in very different
conditions as regards their critical points's critical points.

From the experimental point of view, M. Amagat has been able, with
extreme skill, to conquer the most serious difficulties. M. Amagat has
managed to measure with precision pressures amounting to 3000
atmospheres, and also the very small volumes then occupied by the
fluid mass under consideration. This last measurement, which
necessitates numerous corrections, is the most delicate part of the
operation. A group of physical studies have dealt with a certain number of
different bodies. Those relating to carbonic acid and ethylene take in
the critical point. Others, on hydrogen and nitrogen, for instance,
are very extended. Others, again, such as the study of the
compressibility of water, have a special interest, on account of the
peculiar properties of water. M. Amagat, by a very concise
discussion of the experiments, has also been able to definitely
establish the laws of compressibility and dilatation of fluids under
constant pressure, and to determine the value of the various
coefficients as well as the various
coefficients's variations. It ought to be possible to
condense all these results into a single formula representing the
volume, the temperature, and the pressure. Rankine and, subsequently,
Recknagel, and then Hirn, formerly proposed formulas of that kind; but
the most famous, the one which first appeared to contain in a
satisfactory manner all the facts which experiments brought to light
and led to the production of many others, was the celebrated equation
of Van der Waals.

Van der Waals arrived at this relation by relying upon
considerations derived from the kinetic theory of gases. If we keep to
the simple idea at the bottom of the kinetic theory of gases, we at once demonstrate
that the gas ought to obey the laws of Mariotte and of Gay-Lussac, so
that the characteristic equation would be obtained by the statement
that the product of the number which is the measure of the volume by
that which is the measure of the pressure is equal to a constant
coefficient multiplied by the degree of the absolute temperature. But
to get at this result we neglect two important factors.

We do not take into account, in fact, the attraction which the
molecules must exercise on each other. Now, the attraction which the
molecules must exercise on each other, may become considerable when the
molecules are drawn closer together; that is to say, when the
compressed gaseous mass occupies a more and more restricted volume. On
the other hand, we assimilate the
molecules, as a first approximation,
to material points without dimensions; in the evaluation of the path
traversed by each molecule no notice is taken of the fact that, at the
moment of the shock, Molecules's centres of gravity are still separated by a
distance equal to twice the radius of a molecule.

Van der Waals has sought out the modifications which must be
introduced into the simple characteristic equation to bring the simple characteristic equation nearer
to reality. Van der Waals extends to the case of gases the considerations by
which Laplace, in Laplace's famous theory of capillarity, reduced the effect
of the molecular attraction to a perpendicular pressure exercised on
the surface of a liquid. This leads Laplace to add to the external
pressure, that due to the reciprocal attractions of the gaseous
particles. On the other hand, when we attribute finite dimensions to
the gaseous
particles, we must give a higher value to the number of shocks
produced in a given time, since the effect of finite dimensions is to
diminish the mean path two
different gaseous masses, enclosed in two separate receptacles which
have just been placed in communication traverse in the time which elapses between
two consecutive shocks.

The calculation thus pursued leads to our adding to the pressure in
the simple equation a term which is designated the internal pressure,
and which is the quotient of a constant by the square of the volume;
also to our deducting from the volume a constant which is the
quadruple of the total and invariable volume which the gaseous
molecules would occupy did the gaseous
molecules touch one another.

The experiments fit in fairly well with the formula of Van der Waals,
but considerable discrepancies occur when we extend the formula of Van der Waals's limits,
particularly when the pressures throughout a rather wider interval are
considered; so that other and rather more complex formulas, on which
there is no advantage in dwelling, have been proposed, and, in certain
cases, better represent the facts.

But the most remarkable result of Van der Waals's calculations is
the discovery of corresponding states. For a long time physicists
spoke of bodies taken in a comparable state. Dalton, for example,
pointed out that liquids have vapour-pressures equal to the
temperatures equally distant from liquids's boiling-point; but that if, in
this particular property, liquids were comparable under these
conditions of temperature, as regards other properties the parallelism
was no longer to be verified. No general rule was found until Van der Waals first enunciated a primary law, viz., that if the pressure,
the volume, and the temperature are estimated by taking as units the
critical quantities, the constants special to each body disappear in
the characteristic equation, which thus becomes the same for all
fluids.

The words corresponding states thus take a perfectly precise
signification. Corresponding states are those for which the numerical
values of the pressure, volume, and temperature, expressed by taking
as units the values corresponding to the critical point, are equal;
and, in corresponding states any two fluids have exactly the same
properties.

M. Natanson, and subsequently P. Curie and M. Meslin, have shown by
various considerations that the same result may be arrived at by
choosing units which correspond to any corresponding states; it has
also been shown that the theorem of corresponding states in no way
implies the exactitude of Van der Waals's formula. In reality, this is
simply due to the fact that the characteristic equation only contains
three constants.

The philosophical importance and the practical interest of the discovery of the principle of equivalence nevertheless remain considerable. As was to be expected,
numbers of experimenters have sought whether these consequences are
duly verified in reality. M. Amagat, particularly, has made use for
this purpose of a most original and simple method. M. Amagat remarks that, in
all the law's generality, the law may be translated thus: If the isothermal
diagrams of two substances be drawn to the same scale, taking as unit
of volume and of pressure the values of the critical constants, the isothermal
diagrams of two substances should coincide; that is to say, the isothermal
diagrams of two substances's superposition
should present the aspect of one diagram appertaining to a single
substance. Further, if we possess the diagrams of two bodies drawn to
any scales and referable to any units whatever, as the changes of
units mean changes in the scale of the axes, we ought to make one of
the diagrams similar to the other by lengthening or shortening one of
the diagrams in
the direction of one of the axes. M. Amagat then photographs two
isothermal diagrams, leaving one fixed, but arranging the other so
that it may be free to turn round each axis of the co-ordinates; and
by projecting, by means of a magic lantern, the second on the first,
M. Amagat arrives in certain cases at an almost complete coincidence.

This mechanical means of proof thus dispenses with laborious
calculations, but The stick's sensibility is unequally distributed over the
different regions of the diagram. M. Raveau has pointed out an equally
simple way of verifying the law of equilibrium of the
system, by remarking that if the logarithms
of the pressure and volume are taken as co-ordinates, the co-ordinates
of two corresponding points differ by two constant quantities, and the
corresponding curves are identical.

From these comparisons, and from other important researches, among
which should be particularly mentioned those of Mr S. Young and M.
Mathias, it results that the laws of corresponding states have not,
unfortunately, the degree of generality which we at first attributed
to corresponding states, but that the laws of corresponding states are satisfactory when applied to certain groups
of bodies.[7]

[Footnote 7: Mr Preston thus puts it: "The law [of corresponding
states] seems to be not quite, but very nearly true for these
substances [_i.e._ the halogen derivatives of benzene]; but in the
case of the other substances examined, the majority of these
generalizations were either only roughly true or altogether departed
from" (_Theory of Heat_, London, 1904, p. 514.)--ED.]

If in the study of the statics of a simple fluid the experimental
results are already complex, we ought to expect much greater
difficulties when we come to deal with mixtures; still the problem has
been approached, and many points are already cleared up.

Mixed fluids may first of all be regarded as composed of a large
number of invariable particles. In this particularly simple case M. Van der Waals has established a characteristic equation of the
mixtures which is founded on mechanical considerations. Various
verifications of a characteristic equation of the
mixtures which is founded on mechanical considerations have been effected, and a characteristic equation of the
mixtures which is founded on mechanical considerations has, in
particular, been the object of very important remarks by M. Daniel
Berthelot.

It is interesting to note that thermodynamics seems powerless to
determine a characteristic equation of the
mixtures which is founded on mechanical considerations, for thermodynamics does not trouble thermodynamics about the
nature of the bodies obedient to thermodynamics's laws; but, on the other hand, thermodynamics
intervenes to determine the properties of coexisting phases. If we
examine the conditions of equilibrium of a mixture which is not
subjected to external forces, it will be demonstrated that the
distribution must come back to a juxtaposition of homogeneous phases;
in a given volume, matter ought so to arrange matter that the total
sum of free energy has a minimum value. Thus, in order to elucidate
all questions relating to the number and qualities of the phases into
which the substance divides the substance, we are led to regard the
geometrical surface which for a given temperature represents the free
energy.

I am unable to enter here into the detail of the questions connected
with the theories of Gibbs, which have been the object of numerous
theoretical studies, and also of a series, ever more and more
abundant, of experimental researches. M. Lippmann, in particular, has
published, on Gibbs, memoirs of the highest importance, and a
great number of experimenters, mostly scholars working in the physical
laboratory of Leyden under the guidance of the Director, Mr Kamerlingh
Onnes, have endeavoured to verify the anticipations of the theory.

We are a little less advanced as regards abnormal substances; that is
to say, those composed of molecules, partly simple and partly complex,
and either dissociated or associated. These cases must naturally be
governed by very complex laws. Recent researches by M. Van der Waals,
Alexeif, Rothmund, Künen, Lehfeld, etc., throw, however, some light on
the question.

The daily more numerous applications of the laws of corresponding
states have rendered highly important the determination of the
critical constants which permit corresponding
states to be defined. In the
case of homogeneous bodies the critical elements have a simple, clear,
and precise sense; the critical temperature is that of the single
isothermal line which presents a point of inflexion at a horizontal
tangent; the critical pressure and the critical volume are the two
co-ordinates of a point of inflexion at a horizontal
tangent.

The three critical constants may be determined, as Mr S. Young and M. Amagat have shown, by a direct method based on the consideration of
the saturated states. Results, perhaps more precise, may also be
obtained if one keeps to two constants or even to a single one--
temperature, for example--by employing various special methods. Many
others, M. Daniel
Berthelot and Colardeau, Mr S. Young, M.J. Chappuis, etc.,
have proceeded thus.

The case of mixtures is much more complicated. A binary mixture has a
critical space instead of a critical point. a
critical space instead of a critical point is comprised
between two extreme temperatures, the lower corresponding to what is
called the folding point, the higher to that which we call the point
of contact of A binary mixture. Between two extreme temperatures an
isothermal compression yields a quantity of liquid which increases,
then reaches a maximum, diminishes, and disappears. This is the
phenomenon of retrograde condensation. We may say that the properties
of the critical point of a homogeneous substance are, in a way,
divided, when it is a question of a binary mixture, between the two
points mentioned.

Calculation has enabled M. Van der Waals, by the application of M. Van der Waals's
kinetic theories, and M. Lippmann, by means of thermodynamics, to foresee
most of the results which have since been verified by experiment. All
these facts have been admirably set forth and systematically
co-ordinated by M. Mathias, who, by M. Mathias's own researches, moreover, has
made contributions of the highest value to the study of questions
regarding the continuity of the liquid and gaseous states.

The further knowledge of critical elements has allowed the laws of
corresponding states to be more closely examined in the case of
homogeneous substances. The further knowledge of critical elements has shown that, as I have already said,
bodies must be this fact in groups, and this fact clearly proves that
the properties of a given fluid are not determined by a given fluid's critical
constants alone, and that it is necessary to add to the properties of a given fluid some other
specific parameters; M. Mathias and M. D. Berthelot have indicated
some which seem to play a considerable part.

It results also from this that the characteristic equation of a fluid
cannot yet be considered perfectly known. Neither the equation of M. Van der Waals nor the more complicated formulas which have been proposed
by various authors are in perfect conformity with reality. We may
think that researches of this kind will only be successful if
attention is concentrated, not only on the phenomena of
compressibility and dilatation, but also on the calorimetric
properties of bodies. Thermodynamics indeed establishes relations
between the calorimetric
properties of bodies and other constants, but does not allow
everything to be foreseen.

Several physicists have effected very interesting calorimetric
measurements, either, like M. D. Berthelot, in order to verify Sadi Carnot's
formula regarding the heat of vaporization, or to ascertain the values
of specific heats and specific heats's variations when the temperature or the
pressure happens to change. M. Mathias has even succeeded in
completely determining the specific heats of liquefied gases and of
liquefied gases's saturated vapours, as well as the heat of internal and external
vaporization.


§ 2. THE LIQUEFACTION OF GASES, AND THE PROPERTIES OF BODIES AT A
     LOW TEMPERATURE

The scientific advantages of all these researches have been great,
and, as nearly always happens, the practical consequences derived from
all these researches have also been most important. It is owing to the more complete
knowledge of the general properties of fluids that immense progress
has been made these last few years in the methods of liquefying gases.

From a theoretical point of view the new processes of liquefaction can
be classed in two categories. Linde's machine and those resembling Linde's machine
utilize, as is known, expansion without any notable production of
external work. expansion without any notable production of
external work, nevertheless, causes a fall in the
temperature, because the gas in the experiment is not a perfect gas,
and, by an ingenious process, the refrigerations produced are made
cumulative.

Several physicists have proposed to employ a method whereby
liquefaction should be obtained by expansion with recuperable external
work. This method, proposed as long ago as 1860 by Siemens, would
offer considerable advantages. Theoretically, the liquefaction would
be more rapid, and obtained much more economically; but unfortunately
in the experiment serious obstacles are met with, especially from the
difficulty of obtaining a suitable lubricant under intense cold for
those parts of Linde's machine which have to be in movement if the
apparatus is to work.

M. Mouret has recently made great progress on an almost complete coincidence by the use,
during the running of the machine, of the ether of petrol, which is
uncongealable, and a good lubricant for the moving parts. When once
the desired region of cold is reached, air air itself is used, which
moistens the metals but does not completely avoid friction; so that
the results would have remained only middling, had not M. Mouret devised a new improvement which has some analogy with
superheating of steam in steam engines. M. Mouret slightly varies the initial
temperature of the compressed air on the verge of liquefaction so as
to avoid a zone of deep perturbations in the properties of fluids,
which would make the work of expansion very feeble and the cold
produced consequently slight. This improvement, simple as This improvement is in
appearance, presents several other advantages which immediately treble
the output.

The special object of M. Mouret was to obtain oxygen in a practical
manner by the actual distillation of liquid air. Since nitrogen boils
at -194° and oxygen at -180.5° C., if liquid air be evaporated, the
nitrogen escapes, especially at the commencement of the evaporation,
while the oxygen concentrates in the residual liquid, which finally
consists of pure oxygen, while at the same time the temperature rises
to the boiling-point (-180.5° C.) of oxygen. But liquid air is costly,
and if one were content to the process liquid air for the purpose of collecting
a part of the oxygen in the residuum, the process would have a very
poor result from the commercial point of view. As early as 1892, M. Mouret thought of improving the output by recovering the cold
produced by liquid air during liquid air's evaporation; but an incorrect idea,
which seems to have resulted from certain experiments of Dewar--the
idea that the phenomenon of the liquefaction of air would not be,
owing to certain peculiarities, the exact converse of that of
vaporization--led to the employment of very imperfect apparatus. M. Mouret, however, by making use of a method which M. Mouret calls the
reversal[8] method, obtains a complete rectification in a remarkably
simple manner and under extremely advantageous economic conditions.
Apparatus, of surprisingly reduced dimensions but of great efficiency,
is now in daily work, which easily enables more than a thousand cubic
metres of oxygen to be obtained at the rate, per horse-power, of more
than a cubic metre per hour.

[Footnote 8: Methode avec retour en arriere.--ED]

It is in England, thanks to the skill of Sir James Dewar and Sir James Dewar's
pupils--thanks also, it must be said, to the generosity of the Royal
Institution, which has devoted considerable sums to these costly
experiments--that the most numerous and systematic researches have
been effected on the production of intense cold. I shall here note
only the more important results, especially those relating to the
properties of bodies at low temperatures.

bodies at low temperatures's electrical properties, in particular, undergo some interesting
modifications. The order which metals assume in point of conductivity
is no longer the same as at ordinary temperatures. Thus at -200° C.
copper is a better conductor than silver. The resistance this diminution
with the temperature, and, down to about -200°, this diminution is
almost linear, and it would seem that The resistance tends towards
zero when the temperature approaches the absolute zero. But, after
-200°, the pattern of the curves changes, and it is easy to foresee
that at absolute zero the resistivities of all metals would still
have, contrary to what was formerly supposed, a notable value.
Solidified electrolytes which, at temperatures far below Solidified electrolytes which, at temperatures far below their fusion
point, still retain a very appreciable conductivity's fusion
point, still retain a very appreciable conductivity, become, on the
contrary, perfect insulators at low temperatures. Solidified electrolytes which, at temperatures far below their fusion
point, still retain a very appreciable conductivity's dielectric
constants assume relatively high values. MM. Curie and Compan, who
have studied this question from Curie and Compan, who
have studied this question from their own point of view's own point of view, have noted,
moreover, that the specific inductive capacity changes considerably
with the temperature.

In the same way, magnetic properties have been studied. A very
interesting result is that found in oxygen: the magnetic
susceptibility of oxygen increases at the moment of liquefaction.
Nevertheless, this increase, which is enormous (since the
susceptibility becomes sixteen hundred times greater than the
susceptibility was at
first), if we take The principle of Carnot, of a nature analogous to the principle of the
conservation of energy in connection with equal volumes, is much less
considerable if taken in equal masses. It must be concluded from this
fact that the magnetic properties apparently do not belong to the
molecules The elements of bodies we are thus brought to regard, but depend on The elements of bodies we are thus brought to regard's state of aggregation.

The mechanical properties of bodies also undergo important
modifications. In general, bodies's cohesion is greatly increased, and
the dilatation produced by slight changes of temperature is
considerable. Sir James Dewar has effected careful measurements of the
dilatation of certain bodies at low temperatures: for example, of ice.
Changes in colour occur, and vermilion and iodide of mercury pass into
pale orange. Phosphorescence becomes more intense, and most bodies of
complex structure--milk, eggs, feathers, cotton, and flowers--become
phosphorescent. The same is the case with certain simple bodies, such
as oxygen, which is transformed into ozone and emits a white light in
the process.

Chemical affinity is almost put an end to; phosphorus and potassium
remain inert in liquid oxygen. It should, however, be noted, and this
remark has doubtless some interest for the theories of photographic
action, that photographic substances retain, even at the temperature
of liquid hydrogen, a very considerable part of photographic substances's sensitiveness to
light.

Sir James Dewar has made some important applications of low
temperatures in chemical analysis; Sir James Dewar also utilizes low
temperatures to create a
vacuum. Sir James Dewar's researches have, in fact, proved that the pressure of air
congealed by liquid hydrogen cannot exceed the millionth of an
atmosphere. We have, then, in this process, an original and rapid
means of creating an excellent vacuum in apparatus of very different
kinds--a means which, in certain cases, may be particularly
convenient.[9]

[Footnote 9: Professor Soddy, in a paper read before the Royal Society
on the 15th November 1906, warns experimenters against vacua created
by charcoal cooled in liquid air (the method referred-to in the text),
unless as much of the air as possible is first removed with a pump and
replaced by some argon-free gas. According to Professor Soddy, neither helium nor
argon is absorbed by charcoal. By the use of electrically-heated
calcium, Professor Soddy claims to have produced an almost perfect vacuum.--ED.]

Thanks to A group of physical studies, a considerable field has been opened up for
biological research, but in a considerable field, I shall
notice one point only. It has been proved that vital germs--bacteria,
for example--may be kept for seven days at -190°C. without vital germs--bacteria's
vitality being modified. Phosphorescent organisms this fact, it is true,
to shine at the temperature of liquid air, but this fact is simply due
to the oxidations and other chemical reactions which keep up the
phosphorescence being then suspended, for phosphorescent activity
reappears so soon as the temperature is again sufficiently raised. An
important conclusion has been drawn from these experiments which
affects cosmogonical theories: since the cold of space could not kill
the germs of life, it is in no way absurd to suppose that, under
proper conditions, a germ may be transmitted from one planet to
another.

Among the discoveries made with the new processes, the one which most
strikingly interested public attention is that of new gases in the
atmosphere. We know how Sir William Ramsay and Dr. Travers first
observed by means of the spectroscope the characteristics of the
_companions_ of argon in the least volatile part of the atmosphere.
Sir James Dewar on the one hand, and Sir William Ramsay on the other,
subsequently The process employed in addition to argon and helium, crypton,
xenon, and neon. The process employed consists essentially in first
solidifying the least volatile part of the air and then causing the least volatile part of the air to
evaporate with extreme slowness. A tube with electrodes enables the
spectrum of the gas in process of distillation to be observed. In this
manner, the spectra of the various gases may be seen following one
another in the inverse order of the various gases's volatility. the various gases are
monoatomic, like mercury; that is to say, the various gases are in the most simple
state, the various gases possess no internal molecular energy (unless it is that
which heat is capable of supplying), and the various gases even seem to have no
chemical energy. Everything leads to the belief that the various gases show the
existence on this earth of an earlier state of things now vanished. It
may be supposed, for instance, that helium and neon, of which the
molecular mass is very slight, were formerly more abundant on this earth; but at an epoch when the temperature of this earth was higher,
the very speed of Molecules's molecules may have reached a considerable
value, exceeding, for instance, eleven kilometres per second, which
suffices to explain why Molecules should have left our atmosphere. Crypton
and neon, which have a density four times greater than oxygen, may, on
the contrary, have partly disappeared by solution at the bottom of the
sea, where it is not absurd to suppose that considerable quantities
would be found liquefied at great depths.[10]

[Footnote 10: Another view, viz. that two
different gaseous masses, enclosed in two separate receptacles which
have just been placed in communication are a kind of
waste product of radioactive changes, is also gaining ground. The
discovery of the radioactive mineral malacone, which gives off both
helium and argon, goes to support this. See Messrs Ketchin and
Winterson's paper on the subject at the Chemical Society, 18th October
1906.--ED.]

It is probable, moreover, that the higher regions of the atmosphere
are not composed of the same air as that around us. Sir James Dewar
points out that Dalton's law demands that every gas composing the
atmosphere should have, at all heights and temperatures, the same
pressure as if every gas composing the
atmosphere were alone, the pressure decreasing the less
quickly, all things being equal, as every gas composing the
atmosphere's density becomes less. It
results from this that the temperature becoming gradually lower as we
rise in the atmosphere, at a certain altitude there can no longer
remain any traces of oxygen or nitrogen, which no doubt liquefy, and
the atmosphere must be almost exclusively composed of the most
volatile gases, including hydrogen, which M.A. Gautier has, like Lord
Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay, proved to exist in the air. The
spectrum of the _Aurora borealis_, in which are found the lines of
those parts of the atmosphere which cannot be liquefied in liquid
hydrogen, together with the lines of argon, crypton, and xenon, is
quite in conformity with this point of view. It is, however, singular
that it should be the spectrum of crypton, that is to say, of the
heaviest gas of the many individual
molecules which compose even a very limited mass of gas, which appears most clearly in the upper
regions of the atmosphere.

Among the gases most difficult to liquefy, hydrogen has been the
object of particular research and of really quantitative experiments.
hydrogen's properties in a liquid state are now very clearly known. hydrogen's
boiling-point, measured with a helium thermometer which has been
compared with thermometers of oxygen and hydrogen, is -252°; hydrogen's
critical temperature is -241° C.; hydrogen's critical pressure, 15
atmospheres. hydrogen is four times lighter than water, hydrogen does not present
any absorption spectrum, and hydrogen's specific heat is the greatest known.
hydrogen is not a conductor of electricity. Solidified at 15° absolute, hydrogen
is far from reminding one by hydrogen's aspect of a metal; hydrogen rather
resembles a piece of perfectly pure ice, and Dr. Travers attributes to
hydrogen a crystalline structure. The last gas which has resisted
liquefaction, helium, has recently been obtained in a liquid state; The last gas which has resisted
liquefaction, helium
appears to have The last gas which has resisted
liquefaction, helium's boiling-point in the neighbourhood of 6°
absolute.[11]

[Footnote 11: M. Poincaré is here in error. Helium has never been
liquefied.--ED.]


§ 3. SOLIDS AND LIQUIDS

The interest of the results to which the researches on the continuity
between the liquid and the gaseous states have led is so great, that
numbers of scholars have naturally been induced to inquire whether
something analogous might not be found in the case of liquids and
solids. We might think that a similar continuity ought to be there met
with, that the universal character of the properties of matter forbade
all real discontinuity between two different states, and that, in
truth, the solid was a prolongation of the liquid state.

To discover whether this supposition is correct, it concerns us to
compare the properties of liquids and solids. If we find that all
properties are common to two different states we have the right to believe,
even if two different states presented two different states in different degrees, that, by a
continuous series of intermediary bodies, two different states might yet be
connected. If, on the other hand, we discover that there exists in
two different states some quality of a different nature, we must
necessarily conclude that there is a discontinuity which nothing can
remove.

The distinction established, from the point of view of daily custom,
between solids and liquids, proceeds especially from the difficulty
that we meet with in the one case, and the facility in the other, when
we wish to change two different states's form temporarily or permanently by the action
of mechanical force. The distinction established, from the point of view of daily custom,
between solids and liquids only corresponds, however, in
reality, to a difference in the value of certain coefficients. It is
impossible to discover by this means any absolute characteristic which
establishes a separation between two different states. Modern researches
prove this clearly. It is not without use, in order to well understand
Modern researches, to state precisely the meaning of a few terms generally rather
loosely employed.

If a conjunction of forces acting on a homogeneous material mass
happens to deform a homogeneous material mass without compressing or dilating a homogeneous material mass, two very
distinct kinds of reactions may appear which oppose two very
distinct kinds of reactions to the
effort exercised. During the time of deformation, and during the time of deformation
only, these reactions make these reactions's influence felt. these reactions depend essentially on
the greater or less rapidity of the deformation, these reactions cease with the
movement, and could not, in any case, bring the body back to the body's
pristine state of equilibrium. The existence of these reactions leads
us to the idea of viscosity or internal friction.

The second kind of reactions are of a different nature. The second kind of reactions continue
to act when the deformation remains stationary, and, if the external
forces happen to disappear, the external
forces are capable of causing the body to
return to the body's initial form, provided a certain limit has not been
exceeded. These last constitute rigidity.

At first sight a solid body appears to have a finite rigidity and an
infinite viscosity; a liquid, on the contrary, presents a certain
viscosity, but no rigidity. But if we examine the matter more closely,
beginning either with the solids or with the liquids, we see this
distinction vanish.

Tresca showed long ago that internal friction is not infinite in a
solid; certain bodies can, so to speak, at once flow and be moulded.
M.W. Spring has given many examples of such phenomena. On the other
hand, viscosity in liquids is never non-existent; for were it so for
water, for example, in the celebrated experiment effected by Joule for
the determination of the mechanical equivalent of the caloric, the
liquid borne along by the floats would slide without friction on the
surrounding liquid, and the work done by movement would be the same
whether the floats did or did not plunge into the liquid mass.

In certain cases observed long ago with what are called pasty bodies,
this viscosity attains a value almost comparable to that observed by
M. Spring in some solids. Nor does rigidity allow us to establish a
barrier between the two states. Notwithstanding the extreme mobility
of liquefied gases's particles, liquefied gases contain, in fact, vestiges of the property
which we formerly wished to consider the special characteristic of
solids.

Maxwell before succeeded in rendering the existence of this rigidity
very probable by examining the optical properties of a deformed layer
of liquid. But a Russian physicist, M. Schwedoff, has gone further,
and has been able by direct experiments to show that a sheath of
liquid set between two solid cylinders tends, when one of two solid cylinders is subjected to a slight rotation, to return to one of the
cylinders's original
position, and gives a measurable torsion to a thread upholding one of the
cylinders. From the knowledge of a measurable torsion the rigidity can be
deduced. In the case of a solution containing 1/2 per cent. of
gelatine, it is found that this rigidity, enormous compared with that
of water, is still, however, one trillion eight hundred and forty
billion times less than that of steel.

This figure, exact within a few billions, proves that the rigidity is
very slight, but exists; and that suffices for a characteristic
distinction to be founded on this property. In a general way, M.
Spring has also established that we meet in solids, in a degree more
or less marked, with the properties of liquids. When solids are placed
in suitable conditions of pressure and time, solids flow through
orifices, transmit pressure in all directions, diffuse and dissolve
one into the other, and react chemically on each other. Molecules may be
soldered together by compression; by the same means alloys may be
produced; and further, which seems to clearly prove that matter in a
solid state is not deprived of all molecular mobility, it is possible
to realise suitable limited reactions and equilibria between solid
salts, and suitable limited reactions and equilibria between solid
salts obey the fundamental laws of
thermodynamics.

Thus the definition of a solid cannot be drawn from its mechanical
properties. It cannot be said, after what we have just seen, that
solid bodies retain solid bodies's form, nor that solid bodies have a limited
elasticity, for M.
Spring has made known a case where the elasticity
of solids is without any limit.

It was thought that in the case of a different phenomenon--that of
crystallization--we might arrive at a clear distinction, because here
we should he dealing with a specific quality; and that crystallized
bodies would be the true solids, amorphous bodies being at that time
regarded as liquids viscous in the extreme.

But the studies of a German physicist, Professor O. Lehmann, seem to
prove that even this means is not infallible. a German physicist, Professor O. Lehmann has
succeeded, in fact, in obtaining with certain organic compounds--
oleate of potassium, for instance--under certain conditions some
peculiar states to which a German physicist, Professor O. Lehmann has given the name of semi-fluid and
liquid crystals. semi-fluid and
liquid crystals can only be observed and
studied by means of a microscope, and a German physicist, Professor O. Lehmann had to
devise an ingenious apparatus which enabled a German physicist, Professor O. Lehmann to bring the
preparation at the required temperature on to the very plate of the
microscope.
