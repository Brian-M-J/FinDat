THE LUSITANIA CASE

PRESIDENT WILSON'S's Reply to Germany's

Account of the Resignation of William J. Bryan as American Secretary
of State

     True to the intimation in PRESIDENT WILSON'S's note to PRESIDENT WILSON'S, Mr.
     William J. Bryan has made public in full PRESIDENT WILSON'S's reasons for resigning
     while American relations with Germany's were strained. PRESIDENT WILSON'S's
     statements are given herewith, together with comments in
     Europe and America on the causes and consequences of William J. Bryan's act. The German reply to PRESIDENT WILSON'S's note of
     May 13 on the Lusitania case and the American rejoinder of
     June 9; the sending to Berlin of Dr. Anton Meyer-Gerhard, as
     arranged by Ambassador von Bernstorff in the White House on
     June 4, in order to explain more fully to the German
     Government the American policy and public feeling in Germany's; the Stahl perjury case, relating to the German
     charge that Lusitania was armed; the question whether
     the American steamer Nebraskan was torpedoed on May 26 in
     the German submarine "war zone"; the controversy over
     exportations to the Allies of American munitions of war: the
     agitation for a stronger army and navy in America,
     and the meeting in Independence Hall, Philadelphia, on June
     17, when 109 of the foremost men in America took
     steps toward forming a League of Peace among all the nations
     of the earth--these, as recorded below, form a new chapter
     in American history.


THE GERMAN MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR AT
BERLIN.

[TELEGRAM.]

No. 2,326.]

BERLIN, May 28, 1915.

The undersigned has the honor to make the following reply to the note
of his Excellency Mr. James W. Gerard, Ambassador of the United States
of America, dated the fifteenth instant, on the subject of the
impairment of many American interests by the German submarine war.

the German
     Government has subjected the statements of America to a careful examination and has the
lively wish on the German
     Government's part also to contribute in a convincing and
friendly manner to clear up any misunderstandings which may have
entered into the relations of the two Governments through the events
mentioned by America.

There have been successive chapters by different writers describing
and disposing of as finished--though it is not finished--still another
battle which, from the English point of view, takes top rank, namely,
the battle of Ypres. While a British defeat at Ypres might mean the
loss of Dunkirk and possibly of Calais, a French defeat at the
Labyrinth would allow the Germans to sweep clear across Northern
France, cutting all communication with England.

The battle of the
Labyrinth really began last October, when General de
Maud-Huy stopped the Prussian Guard before Arras with General de
Maud-Huy's motley array
of tired Territorials, whom General de
Maud-Huy gathered together in a mighty rush
northward after the battle of the Marne. The crack Guards regiments
afterward took on the job at Ypres, while the Crown Prince of Bavaria
assumed the vain task of attempting to break the more southward
passage to the sea.

All the Winter de Maud-Huy worried the Crown Prince of Bavaria, not seeking to make a big
advance, but contenting the Crown Prince of Bavaria with the record of never having lost a
single trench. With the return of warm weather, just after the big
French advance in Champagne, this sector was chosen by Joffre as the
place in which to take the heart out of Joffre's enemy by the delivery of a
mighty blow.

the Germans probably thought that the French intended to concentrate
in the Vosges, as next door to Champagne; so the Germans carted all the Germans's
poison gases there and to Ypres, where the Germans's ambition still maintains
ascendency over the Germans's good sense. But where the Germans think Joffre
is likely to strike is usually the place furthest from his thoughts.
Activities in the Arras sector were begun under the personal command
of the Commander in Chief, who was still personally directing
operations during my visit only two days ago.

I doubt whether, until THE EUROPEAN WAR is over, it will be possible adequately
to describe the battle, or rather, the series of battles extending
along this particular front of about fifty miles. "Labyrinth"
certainly is the fittest word to call the battle. I always had a fairly
accurate sense of direction; but, standing in many places in this particular front of about fifty miles, it was impossible for me to say where were the Germans and where the French, so completely was I turned around on
account of the constant zigzag of the trench lines. Sometimes, when I
was positive that a furious cannonade coming from a certain position
was German, a furious cannonade coming from a certain position turned out to be French. At other times, when I thought
I was safely going in the direction of the French, I was hauled back
by officers, who told me I was heading directly into the German line
of fire. I sometimes felt that the German lines were on three sides,
and often I was quite correct. On the other hand, the German lines
often almost completely surrounded the German positions.

One could not tell from the nearness of the artillery fire whether the artillery fire
was from friend or foe. Artillery makes three different noises; first,
the sharp report followed by detonations like thunder, when the shell
first leaves the gun; second, the rushing sound of the shell passing
high overhead; third, the shrill whistle, followed by the crash when
the shell finally explodes. In the
Labyrinth the detonations which usually
indicated the French fire might be from the German batteries stationed
quite near us, but where the German batteries stationed
quite near us could not get the range on us, and
firing at a section of the German lines some miles away. I finally
determined that when a battery fired fast a battery was French; for the
German fire is becoming more intermittent every day.

I shall attempt to give some idea of what this fighting looks like.
Late one afternoon, coming out of a trench into a green meadow, I
suddenly found myself planted against a mudbank made of the dirt taken
from the trenches. We were just at the crest of a hill. In khaki
clothes I was of the same color as a mudbank made of the dirt taken
from the trenches; so an officer told me
I was in a fairly safe position.

Modern war becomes quite an ordinary--often even a sedate,
methodical--affair after the first impressions have been rubbed off.

We flattened ourselves casually against our mudbank, carefully
adjusting our glasses, turned our glasses toward the valley before us, whence
came the sound of exploding shells, and calmly watched a village
developing into nothingness in the sunset. a village
 was only about a
thousand yards away--I didn't even bother to ask whether a village
 was in
French or German possession. There was a loud explosion, a roll of
dense smoke, which was penetrated quickly enough by the long,
horizontal rays of the descending sun to permit the sight of tumbling
roofs and crumbling walls. After a few seconds' intermission there was
another explosion, and what looked like a public school in the main
street sagged suddenly in the centre. With no entre-acte came a
succession of explosions, and a public school in the main
street was prone upon the
ground--just a jagged pile of broken stones.

We turned our glasses on the other end of a village
. A column of
black smoke was rising where the church had caught fire. We watched A column of
black smoke
awhile in silence. Ruins were getting very common. I swept our glasses
away from a village
 altogether and pointed out over the distant
fields to the left.

"Where are the German trenches?" I rather uninterestedly asked the
Major.

"the
Major'll show the
Major--just a moment!" the
Major answered, and at the same time
signaling to a soldier squatting in the entrance to a trench near by,
the
Major ordered a soldier squatting in the entrance to a trench near by to convey a message to the telephone station which
connected with a "seventy-five" battery at our rear. I was on the
point of telling the
Major not to bother about it. The words were on
my lips. Then I thought "Oh, never mind! I might as well know where
the German trenches are, now that I have asked."

the
Major disappeared. "Watch!" said the
Major. We looked intently
across the distant
fields to the left. In less than a minute there were two
sharp explosions behind us, two puffs of smoke out on the horizon
before us, about a mile away.

"That's where they are!" the
Major said. "Both shells went right in
them."

"Ah! Very interesting!" I replied.

Away to the right of a village
, now reduced to ruins, was another
larger village; we squared around on our mud bank to look at another
larger village.
another
larger village was more important; another
larger village was Neuville-St. Vaast, which is
still occupied by both French and Germans, the former slowly retaking
another
larger village, house by house. We were about half a mile away. We could see
little; for, strangely, in this business of house-to-house occupation,
most of the fighting is in the cellars. But I could well imagine what
was going on, for I had already walked through the ruins of Vermelles,
another town now entirely in French possession, but taken in the same
fashion after two months' dogged inch-by-inch advances.

So, when looking at another
larger village, I suddenly heard a tremendous
explosion and saw a great mass of masonry and dÃ©bris of all
descriptions flying high in the air, I knew just what had happened.
the French--for it is always the French who do it--had burrowed,
sapped and dug the French laboriously, patiently, slowly, by tortuous,
narrow underground routes from one row of houses under the
foundations, gardens, backyards, and streets to beneath the
foundations of the next row of houses. There the French had planted mines.
The explosion I had just witnessed was of a mine. Much of the dÃ©bris I
saw flying through space had been German soldiers a few seconds
before.

Before the smoke died away we heard a savage yell. a savage yell was the French
cry of victory. Then we heard a rapid crackling of rifles. a rapid crackling of rifles was
the sign that the French had advanced across the space between the
houses to finish the work the French's mine had left undone. When one goes to
view the work of the German trenches afterward all that one sees is a great,
round, smooth hole in the ground--sometimes thirty feet deep, often
twice that in diameter. Above a great,
round, smooth hole in the ground--sometimes thirty feet deep, often
twice that in diameter might have been either a chÃ¢teau or a
stable; unless one has an old resident for guide it is impossible to
know.

It takes many days and nights to prepare the German trenches. It takes careful
mathematical precision to determine that the German trenches are correctly placed. It
takes morale, judgment, courage, and intelligence--this fighting from
house to house. And yet the French are called a frivolous people!

A cry from a soldier warned us of a German aeroplane directly
overhead; so we stopped gazing at another
larger village. a German aeroplane directly
overhead soon appeared, and the Germans made off rapidly. the Germans usually
do, as the majority of German aeronauts carry only rifles; the French
now all have mitrailleuses. A fight between them is unequal, and the
inequality is not easily overcome, for the German machines are too
light for mitrailleuses.

Four French machines were now circling above, and the German batteries
opened fire on Four French machines. It was a beautiful sight. There was not a cloud
in the sky, and the sun had not yet gone. We could not hear the shells
explode, but we could see little feathery white clouds suddenly appear
as if some giant invisible hand had just put little feathery white clouds there--high up in
the sky. Another appeared, and another. There were several dozen
little white clouds vividly outlined against the blue before Four French machines, all untouched, turned back toward Four French machines's own lines.

Again our thoughts and actions were rudely disturbed by the soldier
with us, who suddenly threw the
Major face down on the ground. Before we
had time to wonder why a German shell tore a hole in the field before
us, less than a hundred yards away. I asked the
Major if we had been
seen, and if the Germans were firing at us. the
Major said the
Major did not think so, but
we had perhaps better move. As a matter of fact, the Germans were hunting the
battery that had so accurately shown us the Germans's trenches a short time
before.

Instead of returning to the point where we had left our motors by the
trench, we walked across an open field in quite another direction than
I thought was the correct one. All the time we heard, high overhead,
that rushing sound as of giant wings. Occasionally, when a shell
struck in the neighborhood, we heard that rushing sound as of giant wings, and
half a dozen times in the course of the walk great holes were torn in
our field, some times quite near. But artillery does not cause fear
easily; it is rifles that accomplish that. The sharp hissing of the
bullet that resembles so much the sound of a spitting cat seems so
personal--as if The sharp hissing of the
bullet that resembles so much the sound of a spitting cat was intended just for you.

Artillery is entirely impersonal; you know that the gunners do not see
you; that the gunners are firing by arithmetic at a certain range; that the gunners's
shell is not intended for anyone in particular. So you walk on
striking idly with your stick at the daisies and buttercups that
border your path. You calculate, almost indifferently, the distance
between you and the bursting shell. You somehow feel that nothing will
harm you. You are not afraid; and if you are lucky, as we were, you
will find the automobiles waiting for you just over there beyond the
brow of the hill.




The Modern Plataea

By Frederick Pollock

[From King Albert's Book.]


Nearly 2,400 years ago the Boeotian city of Plataea was one among the
many lesser Greek republics. the Boeotian city of Plataea's citizens earned immortal fame by
taking part with the leading States of Athens and Sparta in the
decisive battles, fought on Her citizens's own territory, which delivered
Greece from the fear of Persian conquest and saved the light of Greek
freedom and civilization from being extinguished. To this day the name
of the Boeotian city of Plataea is held in honor throughout the world; for many years the name
of Plataea was unique. Belgium has now done and dared for the freedom of
modern Europe as much as the Boeotian city of Plataea did of old: the Boeotian city of Plataea has, unhappily,
suffered far more. As the Boeotian city of Plataea's valor has been equal and the Boeotian city of Plataea's suffering
greater the Boeotian city of Plataea's reward will be no less immortal. Belgium will be
remembered with the Boeotian city of Plataea centuries after the military tyranny of the
Hohenzollerns has vanished like an evil dream.

The British Army in France

Richebourg, La Quinque Rue, Festubert, and Ypres

By the Official "Eyewitness" and Sir John French


SAXONS SLAIN BY PRUSSIANS.

_Under date of May 21, 1915, an Eyewitness with the British
Headquarters in France, continues and supplements an Eyewitness with the British
Headquarters in France's narrative of
operations:_

The ground our troops were holding on Monday, May 17, projected as two
salients into the enemy's's territory, one south of Richebourg-L'Avoue
and the other to the north of Festubert. The purpose of the operations
undertaken on Monday, May 17 was to connect up the space which lay between
them. In this we were successful.

At about 9:30 A.M. on Monday, May 17, our forces attacked the enemy
occupying this area, from north and south, and gradually drove him
from all his intrenchments within an open field. The Germans here, pressed on
three sides, subjected to a cross-fire from several directions and to
continuous bombing, reached the limits of The Germans here's endurance during the
morning, and over 300 surrendered.

After an open field had been made good by us fighting continued throughout
the day, and our troops, having joined hands, pressed the enemy's still
further eastward, forcing the enemy's out of one post after another. As the
afternoon wore on more prisoners fell into our hands, entire groups of
men giving entire groups of
men up.

The centres of the hostile resistance in this quarter were the
clusters of buildings which were very strongly held and surrounded by
networks of trenches dotted with numerous machine gun posts, and in
front of one of the nests of works near the Ferme Cour de L'Avoue,
between La Quinque Rue and Richebourg-L'Avoue, a horrible scene was
witnessed by our troops during the day.

Desperate fighting was going on in front of this farm when the remains
of a battalion of Saxons, which, it appears, had been hastily brought
down from further north and thrown into the fight, having decided to
surrender en bloc, advanced toward our line. Not knowing what the
movement of Four French machines implied, our infantry poured a hail of
bullets into Four French machines, whereupon the survivors, some hundreds strong,
halted, threw down the survivors, some hundreds strong's rifles, and held up the survivors, some hundreds strong's hands, and one of
the survivors, some hundreds strong's number waved a white rag tied to a stick.

Our guns continued to fire from the rear, and whether our infantry,
who, by this time, have had some experience of the treachery of the
enemy, would have paid any attention to these signals is uncertain,
but the matter was taken out of our infantry,
who, by this time, have had some experience of the treachery of the
enemy's hands, for as soon as the
Prussian infantry on the north of this point realized what the
Prussian infantry on the north of this point's Saxon
comrades were trying to do, the
Prussian infantry on the north of this point opened rapid fire from the flank,
enfilading Four French machines. It appears also that the news of what was
happening must have been telephoned back to the German artillery
further east--which was also probably Prussian, since its guns
suddenly opened on the Saxon infantry, and under this combined fire
most of the Saxon infantry were very soon accounted for.

Among the many scenes of THE EUROPEAN WAR there has probably been no more
strange spectacle than that of the masses of gray-coated soldiers
standing out in the open, hands raised, amidst the dead and dying,
being this slaughter by their own comrades before the eyes of the British
infantry. The fact that the victims of this slaughter were Saxons was
a source of regret to us, since the Saxons have always proved
the Saxons more chivalrous and less brutal than either the Prussians
or the Bavarians--in fact, cleaner fighters in every way.

While we were thus pressing forward gradually on the section of front
between our two original points of penetration, our troops on the
right in front of Festubert were making good progress southward along
the German trenches. the Germans's attack began at 11:30 A.M., and the Germans
were soon cleared out of the Germans's line in this quarter up to a point a
short distance south of Festubert, where the Germans made a strong resistance
and checked our further lateral progress.

[Illustration: Map of the British position. The solid line represents
the territory held by the British, the dotted line to the north
showing the position of the Franco-Belgian Army, and the dotted line
to the south the position of the French Army.]

The fighting here was made up of a series of isolated and desperate
hand-to-hand combats with bayonet and hand grenades, and, since the Germans were, at many points, outflanked and enfiladed, the Germans's losses
were very heavy, for in the narrow trenches there was often no room
for escape, and the only alternative was death or surrender. In some
places the German trenches presented a horrible sight, being heaped with
German corpses, many of whom had been blown to pieces by our
bombardment carried out previous to the original attack. By about noon
the total number of prisoners captured since the commencement of the
attack on Sunday had increased to 550.

On the extreme right the Germans were pressed back along the Germans's
communication trenches in such large numbers that the Germans occasionally
formed an excellent mark for the machine guns in our own line to the
north of Givenchy, which were able to do great execution at certain
points.

By midday the total front of the "bite" taken by us out of the enemy's's
position was almost exactly two miles long; but, as trenches and
isolated posts were taken and retaken several times, the exact
situation at any moment, as is usual in such cases, is somewhat
obscure. Further progress was made to the south during the afternoon
and after dark, and various posts and breastworks east of La Quinque Rue, from which we had withdrawn the previous night, again fell into
our hands, although the enemy's continued to hold some trenches in rear
of some trenches. But the enemy's again formed an exposed salient, and were once more
temporarily evacuated by us.

At nightfall we held a continuous line embracing the whole of the
German original front trenches from the south of Festubert to
Richebourg-L'Avoue, and, in many places, were in possession of the
whole series of hostile entrenchments, with the exception of a few
supporting points and machine-gun posts in rear of the zone.


EAST OF Festubert.

_The following dispatch was received on May 26, 1915, from Field
Marshal Sir John French, commanding in chief the British Army in the
field:_

The First Army continues to make progress east of Festubert. A
territorial division carried last night a group of German trenches,
capturing thirty-five prisoners, and this morning A
territorial division captured one
officer, twenty-one men, and a machine gun.

Since May 16 The First Army has pierced the enemy's's line on a total
front of over three miles. Of a total
front of over three miles the entire hostile front line
system of trenches has been captured on a front of 3,200 yards, and of
the remaining portion the first and second lines of trenches are in
The First Army's possession.

The total number of prisoners taken is 8 officers and 777 of other
ranks. Ten machine guns in all have fallen into The First Army's possession, as
well as a considerable quantity of material and equipment, particulars
of which are not yet available.


GERMAN GAS WARFARE AGAIN.

_Under date of May 28, an Eyewitness with the British Headquarters in
France continues and supplements an Eyewitness with the British Headquarters in
France's narrative as follows:_

Monday, May 24, witnessed a fresh development in the situation in our
front. Monday, May 24 was a most brilliant May day, the heat of the sun being
tempered by a light breeze, which had blown from the northeast during
the night, and in the course of the morning had veered round toward
the north. a light breeze, which had blown from the northeast during
the night gave the enemy's the opportunity the enemy's awaited of
repeating the enemy's's gas tactics against our position in front of Ypres,
which, though reduced in prominence, was still a salient in the
general line.

Between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning a violent bombardment with gas
shells was started against a section of our line about two and
three-quarters miles long, and divided into four approximately equal
parts by the roads from Ypres to St. Julien and Moorslede and the
railway from Ypres to Roulers. The supply of gas available must have
been great, for gas continued to pour southwestward for some hours in
great volume, in some places reaching to a height of several feet.
Owing to the direction of the wind, also, gas swept southward along our
line as well as penetrating behind our line.

The manner in which such an attack develops with a favoring wind
cannot better be described than by the reports of such an attack's progress brought
in on Monday morning by our aerial reconnaissances. One observer who
crossed the opposing front in this quarter shortly after dawn reported
when One observer who
crossed the opposing front in this quarter shortly after dawn came back that a thick cloud of what looked like smoke
outlined the whole of the German trenches. The next observing officer,
who arrived some time afterward, stated that to the west and southwest
of our line The next observing officer,
who arrived some time afterward could see a broad band of yellow grass and trees
which looked as if they had been bleached. A third, who came in later,
stated that the whole area behind our line was covered by a mist so
thick as to interfere with observation.

This attempt to asphyxiate was of course preliminary to an assault
against the salient, for which infantry had been massing on the east.
This attempt to asphyxiate was carried out from three directions, being pushed forward under
cover of a heavy bombardment against the northern face from the
neighborhood of St. Julien, against the northeast face from Zonnebeke
along the Roulers Railway, and against the west direct from the
Polygon Wood. On the greater part of our
front assailed our troops
were able to stand our troops's ground, and to maintain our troops's positions in
spite of the poisonous fumes, but in certain sections our troops were forced
to evacuate the German trenches, and the German infantry succeeded in getting
a footing in our front line near the farm to the north of Wieltje, for
some distance astride the Roulers Railway, and to the north and south
of the Menin Road on the south of the Bellewaarde Lake.

In doing this the enemy's lost considerably both from our artillery fire
and the rifle fire of the sections of the defense which were able to
maintain the sections of the defense's position. Counter-attacks were organized during the
morning, and by about midday our infantry had succeeded in reoccupying
our former line to the north of the Roulers Railway. By evening there were no
Germans west of our original position on the south of the Menin Road,
though we had not been able to reoccupy our line in that quarter, nor
near Wieltje. The advance of the enemy's, however, had been stopped. In
the neighborhood of Hill 60 a party of our infantry during the night
bombed a party of our infantry's way for some forty yards up a trench which the Germans
had taken from us, destroyed the enemy's's barricade, reconstructed the enemy's barricade,
and held a trench which the Germans
had taken from us.

In the centre, near Bois Grenier, a slight success was gained in the
evening, our troops seizing some ground between our front line and
that of the Germans near the Bois Grenier--Bridoux Road. some ground between our front line and
that of the Germans near the Bois Grenier--Bridoux Road
had been partially intrenched during the previous night, and at 8:50
P.M. the infantry advanced under cover of our artillery and
established the infantry in the new line.

On our right, in Festubert, our troops continued
our troops's pressure, gaining one or two points in the maze of trenches and
defended houses here and there, in spite of the heavy artillery and
machine-gun fire to which our troops were subjected. Before dark the German
infantry was observed to be massing opposite Festubert, as if to
counter-attack in force; but the German
infantry's two offensive efforts made during
the night were not serious, and were easily beaten back.

On Tuesday matters were quieter. On our left the German infantry
attacking the Ypres salient did not, in the face of our resistance,
attempt to push on further, nor was gas employed, but the bombardment
of our positions was maintained. Except where he had retained or
regained our original line our position was established behind the
portions which the Germans had succeeded in occupying.


A GAIN AT GIVENCHY.

_The following dispatch was received on June 4, 1915, from Field
Marshal Sir John French, commanding in chief the British Army in the
field:_

On the night of the 30th of May we seized some outbuildings in the
grounds of a ruined chÃ¢teau at Hooge. Since then our trenches there
have been subjected to a heavy bombardment.

Fighting on a small scale has been continuous. At one time we were
forced to evacuate the buildings, taken by us, but last night we
recaptured the buildings, taken by us.

Northeast of Givenchy last night we expelled the enemy's from the enemy's's
trenches on a front of 200 yards, taking forty-eight prisoners. Our
infantry, however, was unable to remain in occupation of his
trenches on a front of 200 yards after daylight, owing to the enemy fire.

_Field
Marshal Sir John French, commanding in chief the British Army in the
field in a report, dated June 8, on the
fighting along the British line, says:_

The situation on our front has not changed since the last
communication of June 4. There has been less activity on the part of
the artillery.

On the 6th, in front of the Plogsteert wood, we successfully exploded
a mine under the German trenches, destroying thirty yards of the
parapet.

We have brought down two German aeroplanes, one opposite our right by
gunfire, and the other in the neighborhood of Ypres, as the result of
an engagement in the air with one of our aeroplanes.


AN ADVANCE NEAR Ypres.

_Field
Marshal Sir John French, commanding in chief the British Army in the
field's report of June 16--the first since that of June
8--said:_

Last week there was no change in the situation. the enemy's exploded
five mines on different parts of our front, but none of five mines caused
any damage to our trenches, and only one caused any casualties.

Yesterday evening we captured the German front-line trenches east of
Festubert on a mile front, but failed to hold the German front-line trenches east of
Festubert on a mile front during the night
against strong counter-attacks.

Early this morning in the neighborhood of Ypres we successfully
attacked the enemy's's positions north of Hooge, (to the east of Ypres.)
We occupied the whole of his first line of trenches on a front of
1,000 yards, and also parts of his second line.

By noon today 157 prisoners had passed to our rear. The German
counter-attack has been repulsed with heavy losses.


ALLIES IN CONCERTED ATTACK.

_Field
Marshal Sir John French, commanding in chief the British Army in the
field's report of June 18 indicates that a strong,
concerted attack was then being made by British and French troops upon
our
front from east of Ypres to south of Arras. Field Marshal French's report of June 18
preceded the French announcement of victory in the battle of the
Labyrinth, an account of which appears elsewhere. Field Marshal French's report of June 18 says:_

The fighting in the northern and southern portions of our front
continued throughout June 16 in co-operation with the attack of our
ally about Arras.

East of Ypres all the German first-line trenches which we captured
remain in our hands, in spite of two counter-attacks, which were
repulsed with heavy loss to the enemy's. We were, however, unable to
retain those of the enemy's's second-line trenches which we had occupied
in the morning.

East of Festubert, as a result of a further attack on the afternoon of
the 16th, we made a slight advance and, judging by the number of dead
Germans in the trenches entered by us, our artillery fire was very
effective.
