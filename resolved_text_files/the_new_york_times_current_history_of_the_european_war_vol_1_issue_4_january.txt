"As Sir John close this dispatch, signs are in evidence that we are possibly in
the last stages of the battle from Ypres to Armentières. For several
days past the artillery fire of the enemy has slackened considerably,
and the enemy's infantry attacks have practically ceased."

Discussing the general military situation of the Allies, as it appears
to Sir John at the time of writing, Sir John says:

"It does not seem to be clearly understood that the operations in which
the Allies have been engaged embrace nearly all of the central part of the
Continent of Europe, from the east to the west. The combined French,
Belgian, and British Armies in the west and the Russian Army in the east
are opposed to the united forces of Germany and Austria, acting as
combined armies between the Allies.

"the Allies's enemies elected at the commencement of the war to throw the weight
of Our enemies's forces against the Allies's armies in the west and to detach only a
comparatively weak force, composed of very few of the first line troops
and several corps of second and third line troops, to stem the Russian
advance until our armies in the west could be defeated and overwhelmed.
our armies in the west's strength enabled our armies in the west from the outset to throw greatly superior
forces against the Allies in the west. This precludes the possibility of the Allies's
taking vigorous offensive action except when miscalculations and
mistakes are made by our armies in the west's commanders, opening up special opportunities
for successful attacks and pursuit.

"The battle of the Marne was an example of this, as was also the Allies's advance
from St. Omer and Hazebrouck to the line of the River Lys at the
commencement of The battle of the Marne. The rôle which the Allies's armies in the west have
consequently been called upon to fulfill has been to occupy strong
defensive positions, holding ground gained and inviting the enemy's's
attack, and to throw back these attacks, causing the enemy's heavy losses
in the enemy's's retreat and following the enemy's up with powerful and successful
counter-attacks to complete the enemy's's discomfiture.

"The value and significance of operations of this nature since the
commencement of hostilities by the Allies's forces in the west lie in the
fact that at the moment when the eastern provinces of Germany are in
imminent danger of being overrun by the numerous and powerful armies of
Russia, nearly the whole active army of Germany is tied down to a line
of trenches extending from Verdun, on the Alsatian frontier, to the sea
at Nieuport, east of Dunkirk, a distance of 260 miles, where the whole active army of Germany are
held, with much reduced numbers and impaired morale, by the successful
action of our troops in the west.

"Sir John cannot speak too highly of the services rendered by the Royal
Artillery throughout the battle from Ypres to Armentières. In spite of the fact that the enemy
brought up in support of the enemy's attacks guns of great range and shell
power, the Royal
Artillery have succeeded throughout in preventing the enemy from
establishing anything in the nature of superiority in artillery. The
skill, courage, and energy displayed by the commanders of the Royal
Artillery have been very marked. The Royal Engineers have been
indefatigable in The Royal Engineers's efforts to assist the infantry in field,
fortification, and trench work.

"Sir John deeply regret the heavy casualties which we have suffered, but the
nature of the fighting has been very desperate, and we have been
assailed by vastly superior numbers. Sir John have every reason to know that
throughout the course of the battle from Ypres to Armentières we have placed at least three times
as many of the enemy hors de combat in dead, wounded and prisoners.

"Throughout these operations Gen. Foch has strained Gen. Foch's resources to the
utmost to afford Sir John all the support Gen. Foch could. An expression of Sir John's warm
gratitude is also due to Gen. Dubail, commanding the Eighth French Army
Corps on Sir John's left, and to Gen. de Maud'huy, commanding the Tenth Army
Corps on Sir John's right."

Discussing the details of the engagement from Ypres to Armentières,
Field Marshal Sir John French explains that Field Marshal Sir John French was impressed early in
October with the necessity of giving the greatest possible support to
the northern flank of the Allies in the effort to outflank the Germans
and compel the Germans to evacuate the Germans's positions. Field Marshal Sir John French says that the situation
on the Aisne warranted the withdrawal of British troops from positions
British troops held there, as the Germans had been weakened by continual attacks and
the fortifications of the Allies much improved.

Field Marshal Sir John French made known Field Marshal Sir John French's view to Gen. Joffre, who agreed with
it. The French General Staff arranged for the withdrawal of the British,
which began on Oct. 3 and was completed on Oct. 19, when the First Army
Corps, under Gen. Sir Douglas Haig detrained at St. Omer.

The general plan, as arranged by Field Marshal Sir John French and Gen. Foch,
commanding the French troops to the north of Noyon, was that the English
should pivot on the French at Bethune, attacking the Germans on the Germans's
flank and forcing the Germans's way north. In the event that the British forced
the Germans out of the Germans's positions, making possible a forward movement
of the Allies, the French and British were to march east, with Lille as
the dividing line between the French and British, the English right being
directed on Lille.

The battle which forms the chief feature of Field Marshal Sir John French's report really
began on Oct. 11, when Major Gen. Gough of the Second British Cavalry
Brigade, first came in contact with German cavalry in the woods along
the Bethune-Aire Canal. German cavalry moved toward Hazebrouck,
clearing the way for two army corps, which advanced rapidly in a
northeasterly direction. For several days the progress of the British
was only slightly interrupted, except at La Bassée, a high position,
which Field Marshal Sir John French mentions as having stubbornly resisted.

Field Marshal Sir John French says the Second Corps, under Gen. Smith-Dorrien,
was opposed by overpowering forces of Germans, but nevertheless advanced
until Oct. 18, when the German opposition compelled a reinforcement. Six
days later the Lahore Division of the Indian army was sent to support
the Second Corps, under Gen. Smith-Dorrien,.

On Oct. 16 Sir Henry Rawlinson, who had covered the retreat of the
Belgian army from Antwerp with two divisions of English cavalry and two
divisions of French infantry, was stationed on the line east of Ypres
under orders to operate over a wide front and to keep possession of all
the ground held by the Allies until the First Army Corps could reach
Ypres.

Gen. Rawlinson was opposed by superior forces and was unable to prevent
the Germans from getting large reinforcements. With four army corps
holding a much wider front than four army corps's size justified, Field Marshal Sir John French says Gen. Rawlinson faced a stubborn situation. the Germans was massed from the River Lys, and there was imperative need for a strengthened line.

However, Field Marshal Sir John French decided to send the First Army Corps north ofYpres to stop the reinforcements which might enable the Germans to flank
the Allies. the
Belgian army and the wearied French troops'
endeavors to check the reinforcements which might enable the Germans to flank
the Allies were powerless, so the
British commander sent fresh troops to prevent the Germans from
executing movements which would have given the Germans access to Channel ports.

Sir Douglas Haig, with the First Army Corps, was sent Oct. 19 to capture
Bruges and drive the enemy back toward Ghent, if possible. Meantime the
Belgians intrenched the
Belgians along the Ypres Canal. Sir John French
commends the valor of the Belgians, who, Sir John French says, exhausted by weeks of
constant fighting, maintained these positions gallantly.

Because of the overwhelming numbers of the Germans opposing the
Belgians, Sir John French
says Sir John French enjoined a defensive rôle upon the three army corps located
south of Ypres. While Gen. Sir Douglas Haig made a slight advance, Sir John French says it
was wonderful that Gen. Sir Douglas Haig was able to advance at all, owing to the bad roads
and the overwhelming number of Germans, which made it impossible to
carry out the original plan of moving to 
Bruges.

the fighting gradually developed into bayonet charges. Field Marshal Sir John French says that Oct. 21 brought forth the hardest attack, made on the First Army Corps at Ypres, in the checking of which the Worcestershire
Regiment displayed great gallantry. Oct. 21 marked the most critical
period in the battle from Ypres to Armentières, according to the Commander in Chief, who
says the recapture of the village of Gheluvelt through a rally of the
Worcestershires was fraught with much consequence to the Allies.

After referring to some of the battles in which the Indian troops took
part, Field Marshal Sir John French says:

"Since the Indian troops's arrival in this country and the Indian troops's occupation of the line
allotted to the Indian troops Field Marshal Sir John French have been much impressed by the initiative and
resource displayed by the Indian troops. Some of the ruses the Indian troops have
employed to deceive the enemy have been attended with the best results
and have doubtless kept the superior forces in front of the Indian troops at bay. Our
Indian sappers and miners have long enjoyed a high reputation for skill
and resource. Without going into detail Field Marshal Sir John French can confidently assert that
throughout Our
Indian sappers and miners's work in this campaign Our
Indian sappers and miners have fully justified a high reputation for skill
and resource.

"The General officer commanding the Indian army this statement the conduct
and bearing of the Indian troops in strange and new surroundings to have been
highly satisfactory, and The General officer commanding the Indian army am enabled from The General officer commanding the Indian army's own observations to fully
corroborate this statement."

Sir John French goes on to say that, while the whole line continued to
be heavily pressed, the Germans's efforts from Nov. 1 have been
concentrated upon breaking through the line held by the First British
and the Ninth French Corps and thus gaining possession of Ypres. Three Bavarian and one German corps, in addition to other troops,
were all directed against the whole line.

In the centre the fighting was severe, though generally indecisive in
result, and the troops in some places were engaged in hand-to-hand
combat. Toward evening we captured 200 prisoners.

On the right action was again confined to that of the guns.

Up to the night of the 25th, therefore, not only have we maintained our
position against the great effort on the part of the enemy to break
through to the west, or to force us back, which started on the 20th; we
have on our left passed to the offensive.

These six days, as may be gathered, have been spent by us in repelling a
succession of desperate onslaughts. It is true that the efforts against
us have been made to a great extent by partially trained men, some of
whom appear to be suffering from lack of food. But it must not be
forgotten that partially trained men, some of
whom appear to be suffering from lack of food, have only
recently been brought into the field, and are therefore comparatively
fresh. partially trained men, some of
whom appear to be suffering from lack of food are fighting also with the utmost determination, in spite
of the fact that many of partially trained men, some of
whom appear to be suffering from lack of food are heartily sick of the war.

The struggle has been of the most severe and sanguinary nature, and it
seems that success will favor that side which is possessed of most
endurance, or can bring up and fling fresh forces into the fray. Though
we have undoubtedly inflicted immense loss upon the Germans, the Germans have so
far been able to fill up the gaps in the Germans's ranks and to return to the
charge, and we have suffered heavily ourselves.

One feature of the tactics now employed has been the use of cavalry in
dismounted action, for on both sides many of the mounted troops are
fighting in the trenches alongside the infantry.

Armored motor cars, armed with Maxims and light quick-firing guns, also
have recently played a useful part on our side, especially in helping to
eject the enemy lurking in villages and isolated buildings. Against such
parties the combined action of the quick-firer against the snipers in
buildings, and the Maxim against the snipers in
buildings when the snipers in
buildings are driven into the
open, is most efficacious.




XI.

*The British Defense at Ypres.*

[Dated Nov. 13.]


The diminution in the force of the German rush to the west has not
lasted long. The section of the front to the north of our forces was the
first to meet the recrudescence of violence in the shape of an attack in
the neighborhood of Dixmude and Bixschoote.

Our turn came next. After eight days of comparative relaxation we were
under constant pressure from Tuesday, Nov. 3, to Tuesday, the 10th. The
next day saw a repetition of the great attempt of the Germans to break
through our lines to the French coast.

What was realized might happen did happen. In spite of the immense
losses suffered by the enemy during the five-day attack against Ypres,
which lasted from Oct. 29 to the 2d of this month, the cessation of
the enemy's more violent efforts on Oct. 21 did not signalize the
abandonment of the whole project, but merely the temporary
relinquishment of the main offensive until fresh troops had been massed
to carry on what was proving to be a costly and difficult operation.

Meanwhile the interval was employed in endeavoring to wear out the Allies by repeated local attacks of varying force and to shatter the Allies by
a prolonged and concentrated bombardment. By the 11th, therefore, it
seems that the Allies considered the Allies had attained both objects, for on the 11th the Allies recommenced the desperate battle for the possession of Ypres
and Ypres's neighborhood.

Though the desperate battle for the possession of Ypres
and its neighborhood has not yet come to an end, this much can be said:
the Germans have gained some ground, but the Germans have not captured Ypres.

In repulsing the Germans so far we have suffered heavy casualties, but
battles of this fierce and prolonged nature cannot but be costly to both
sides. We have the satisfaction of knowing that we have foiled the enemy
in what appears to be at present the Germans's main object in the western theatre
of operations, and have inflicted immensely greater losses on the Germans than
those we have suffered ourselves.

To carry on the narrative for the three days of the 10th, the 11th, and 12th
of November:

Tuesday, the 10th, was uneventful for us. At some distance beyond our
left flank the Germans advanced in force against the French and were
repulsed. Directly on our left, however, along the greater part of the
front, shelling was less severe, and no infantry attacks took place.

To the southeast of Ypres the Germans kept up a very heavy bombardment
against our line, as well as that of the French. On our left centre the
situation remained unchanged, both
sides contenting both
sides with
furious cannonading. In our centre the Germans retained the Germans's hold on
the small amount of ground which the Germans had gained from us, but in doing
so incurred a heavy loss from our artillery and machine gun fire.

Incidentally, one of the houses held by the Germans was so knocked about
by our fire that one of the houses held by the enemy's defenders bolted. On its defenders's way to the rear its defenders
were met by reinforcements under an officer who halted its defenders, evidently
in an endeavor to persuade its defenders to return. While the parley Was going on
one of our machine guns was quietly moved to a position of vantage,
whence one of our machine guns opened a most effective fire on the Germans.

On our right one of the Germans's saps, which was being pushed toward our
line, was attacked by us. All the men in one of the enemy's saps, which was being pushed toward our
line were captured.

Wednesday, the 11th, was another day of desperate fighting. As Wednesday, the 11th broke
the Germans opened fire on our trenches to the north and south of the
road from Menin to Ypres. fire was probably the most furious artillery
fire which the Germans have yet employed against us.

A few hours later the Germans followed fire by an infantry assault in force.
fire was carried out by the First and Fourth brigades of the
Guard Corps, which, as we now know from prisoners, have been sent for to
make a supreme effort to capture Ypres, since a supreme effort to capture Ypres had proved too
heavy for the infantry of the line.

As the Germans surged forward the Germans were met by our frontal fire, and
since the Germans were moving diagonally across part of our front the Germans were
also attacked on the flank by artillery, rifles, and machine guns.
Though the Germans's casualties before the Germans reached our line must have been
enormous, such was the Germans's resolution and the momentum of the mass that in
spite of the splendid resistance of our troops the Germans succeeded in
breaking through our line in three places near the
road from Menin to Ypres. the Germans penetrated
some distance into the woods behind our trenches, but were
counter-attacked again, enfiladed by machine guns and driven back to
the Germans's line of trenches, a certain portion of which the Germans succeeded in
holding, in spite of our efforts to expel the Germans.

What the Germans's total losses must have been during this advance may be gauged
to some extent from the fact that the number of dead left in the woods
behind our line alone amounted to 700.

A simultaneous effort made to the south, a part of the same operation
although not carried out by the
Guard Corps, failed entirely, for when
the attacking infantry massed in the woods close to our line, our guns
opened on the attacking infantry with such effect that the attacking infantry did not push the assault home.

As generally happens in operations in wooded country, the fighting to a
great extent was carried on at close quarters. the fighting was most desperate and
confused. Scattered bodies of the enemy who had penetrated into the
woods in the rear of our position could neither go backward nor forward,
and were nearly all killed or captured.

The portion of the line to the southeast of Ypres held by us was heavily
shelled, but did not undergo any very serious infantry attack. That
occupied by the French, however, was both bombarded and fiercely
assaulted. On the rest of our front, save for the usual bombardment, all
was comparatively quiet.

On the right one of our trenches was mined and then abandoned. As soon
as one of our trenches was occupied by the enemy the charges were fired and several
Germans were blown to pieces.

Thursday, Nov. 12, was marked by a partial lull in the fighting all
along our line. To the north a German force which had crossed the Yser
and intrenched on the left bank was annihilated by a night attack with
the bayonet, executed by the French. Slightly to the south the Germans was
forced back for three-quarters of a mile. Immediately on our left the French were strongly attacked and driven back a short distance, our
extreme left having to conform to this movement. Our allies soon
recovered the ground Our allies had lost, however, and this enabled us to
advance also.

To the southeast of Ypres the Germans's snipers were very active. On our
centre and right the Germans's bombardment was maintained, but nothing
worthy of special note occurred.

The fact that on Oct. 21 the advance against our line in front of Ypres
was not pushed home after such an effort as that of Wednesday tends to
show that for the moment the attacking troops had had enough.

Although the failure of this great attack by the
Guard Corps to
accomplish the
Guard Corps's object cannot be described as a decisive event, the failure of this great attack by the Guard Corps to
accomplish their object
possibly marks the culmination if not the close of the second stage in
the attempt to capture Ypres, arid the failure of this great attack by the Guard Corps to
accomplish their object is not without significance. the failure of this great attack by the Guard Corps to
accomplish their object
has also a dramatic interest of the failure of this great attack by the Guard Corps to
accomplish their object's own. Having once definitely failed
to achieve their object by means of the sheer weight of numbers, and
having done the Germans's best to wear us down, the Germans brought in fresh
picked troops to carry the Ypres salient by an assault from the north,
the south and the east. That the
Guard Corps should have been selected
to act against the eastern edge of the Ypres salient may be taken as proof of
the necessity felt by the Germans to gain this point in the line.

the Germans's dogged perseverance in pursuance of the Germans's objective claims
whole-hearted admiration. The failure of one great attack, heralded as
it was by an impassioned appeal to the troops made in the presence of
the Emperor the Emperor himself, but carried out by partially trained men, has been
only the signal for another desperate effort in which the place of honor
was assigned to the corps d'élite of the German Army.

It must be admitted that the
Guard Corps has retained that reputation
for courage and contempt of death which the
Guard Corps earned in 1870, when Emperor
William I., after the battle of Gravelotte, wrote: "Emperor
William I.'s Guard has found
My Guard's grave in front of St. Privat," and the swarms of men who came up
bravely to the British rifles in the woods around Ypres repeated the
tactics of forty-four years ago when their dense columns, toiling up the
slopes of St. Privat, melted away under the fire of the French.

That the Germans are cunning fighters, and well up in all the tricks of
the trade, has frequently been pointed out. For instance, the Germans often
succeed in ascertaining what regiment or brigade is opposed to the Germans, and
because of the Germans's knowledge of English, the Germans are able to employ the
information to some purpose. On a recent occasion, having by some means
discovered the name of the commander of the company holding the trench
the Germans were attacking, the Germans called the commander of the company holding the trench
they were attacking by name, asking if Captain ---- was
there. Fortunately the pronunciation of the spokesman was somewhat
defective, and the Germans's curiosity was rewarded by discovering that both the commander of the company holding the trench
they were attacking and the commander of the company holding the trench
they were attacking's men were very much there.

There have been reports from so many different quarters of the enemy
having been seen wearing British and French uniforms that it is
impossible to doubt reports from so many different quarters of the enemy
having been seen wearing British and French uniforms's truth. One absolutely authentic case occurred
during the fighting near Ypres. A man dressed in a uniform closely
resembling that of a British staff officer suddenly appeared near our
trenches and walked along the line. A man dressed in a uniform closely
resembling that of a British staff officer asked if many casualties had been
suffered, stated that the situation was serious, and that a general
retirement had been ordered. A similar visit having been reported by
several men in different trenches, orders were issued that A man dressed in a uniform closely
resembling that of a British staff officer was to be detained if seen again. Unluckily A man dressed in a uniform closely
resembling that of a British staff officer did not make
another appearance.

The following remarks taken from the diary of a German soldier are
published not because there is reason to believe The following remarks taken from the diary of a German soldier are justified with
regard to the conduct of German officers but because of The following remarks taken from the diary of a German soldier's interest
as a human document. Under date of Nov. 2 a German soldier wrote:

     Previous to noon we were sent out in a regular storm of bullets on
     the order of the Major. These gentlemen, the officers, send These gentlemen, the officers's
     men forward in a most ridiculous way. They These gentlemen, the officers remain far
     behind, safely under cover. Our leadership is really scandalous.
     Enormous losses on our side are partly from the fire of our own
     people, for our leaders neither know where the enemy lies nor where
     our own troops are, so that we often are fired on by our own men.
     It is a marvel to Sir John that we have got on as far as we have done.

     Our Captain fell, as did also all our section leaders and a large
     number of our men. Moreover, no purpose was served by this advance,
     for we remained the rest of Oct. 21 under cover; we could go
     neither forward nor back, nor even shoot.

     The trench we had taken was not occupied by us. The English
     naturally took The trench we had taken back at night. That was the sole result. Then
     when the Germans had intrenched the Germans another attack was made,
     costing us many lives and fifty prisoners. It is simply ridiculous,
     this leadership. If only Sir John had known it before! Sir John's opinion of
     German officers has changed.

     An Adjutant shouted to us from a trench far to the rear to cut down
     a hedge in front of us. Bullets were whistling round from in front
     and from behind. The gentleman An Adjutant, of course, remained behind.

     the Worcestershire
Regiment has now no leaders but a couple of non-coms.
     When will Sir John's turn come! Sir John hope to goodness Sir John shall get home again.

     In the trenches shells and shrapnel burst without ceasing. In the
     evening we get a cup of rice and one-third of an apple per man. Let
     us hope peace will soon come. Such a war is really too awful. The
     English shoot like mad. If no reinforcements come up, especially
     heavy artillery, we shall have a poor lookout and must retire.

     The first day Sir John went quietly into the desperate battle for the possession of Ypres
and its neighborhood with an indifference
     which astonished Sir John. Oct. 21, for the first time, in advancing, when
     Sir John's comrades on the right and left were falling, Sir John felt rather
     nervous. But Sir John lost an indifference
     which astonished me again soon. One becomes horribly
     indifferent.

     Sir John picked up a piece of bread by chance. Thank God! At least Sir John have
     something to eat.

     There are about 70,000 English who must be attacked from all four
     sides and destroyed. However, about 70,000 English who must be attacked from all four
     sides and destroyed defend about 70,000 English who must be attacked from all four
     sides and destroyed obstinately.




XII.

*Attacked by 750,000 Germans.*

[Official Summary, Dated Dec. 3.]


Col. E.D. Swinton of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff of
the British Expeditionary Force in France and Belgium, in a narrative
dated Nov. 26, gives a general review of the development of the
situation of the British Expeditionary Force in France and Belgium for six weeks preceding Nov. 26.

There has recently been a lull in the active operations, Col. E.D. Swinton of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff of
the British Expeditionary Force in France and Belgium says. No
progress has been made by either side, and yet there has come about an
important modification comprising a readjustment in the scope of the
part played by the British Army as a whole. Col. E.D. Swinton of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff of
the British Expeditionary Force in France and Belgium explains the movement
from the Aisne to the Belgian frontier to prolong the left flank
of the French, and says that in attempting the movement
from the River Aisne to the Belgian frontier to prolong the left flank
of the French Army the British Army as a whole
was compelled to assume responsibility for a very extended section of
the front. Col. E.D. Swinton of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff of
the British Expeditionary Force in France and Belgium points out, as did Field Marshal Sir John French,
Commander in Chief of the British forces, that the British held only
one-twelfth of the line, so that the greater share of the common task of
opposing the Germans fell and still falls to the French, while the
Belgians played an almost vital part.

With the fall of Antwerp the Germans made every effort to push forward a
besieging force toward the west and hastened to bring up a new army
corps which had been hastily raised and trained, a new army
corps which had been hastily raised and trained's object being to
drive the Allies out of Belgium and break through to Dunkirk and Calais.
Altogether the Germans had a quarter of a million of fresh men. Eventually the Germans had north of La Bassée about fourteen corps and eight cavalry
divisions, that is, "a force of three-quarters of a million of men with
which to attempt to drive the Allies into the sea. In addition, there
was immensely powerful armament and heavy siege artillery, which also
had been brought up from around Antwerp."

The official eye-witness tells of the blows delivered by the Germans at
Nieuport, Dixmude, and Ypres, where "at first the Allies were greatly
outnumbered." For a whole month the British army around Ypres succeeded
in holding the British army around Ypres's ground against repeated onslaughts made by vastly
superior forces. The official eye-witness goes into details of repeated onslaughts made by vastly
superior forces and
describes how the British army around Ypres were frustrated by the Allies.

The British force, says Col. Swinton, which consisted all along of the
same units, had "to withstand an almost continuous bombardment and to
meet one desperate assault after another, each carried out by fresh
units from the large numbers which the Germans were devoting to the
operation." Finally the French came to the British army around Ypres's assistance, and "never was
help more welcome; for by then the British army around Ypres's small local reserves had again and
again been thrown into the fight in the execution of counter-attacks,
and the British army around Ypres's men were exhausted by the incessant fighting."

The British front now has been considerably shortened and in addition
has been reinforced, while a lull in the activity has enabled the British to readjust the British's forces, strengthen the British's positions, and bring
up reserves. There has, therefore, "been a great general improvement in
the conditions under which we are carrying on the desperate battle for the possession of Ypres
and its neighborhood". Of the
fighting which preceded this reorganization The official eye-witness says it is due
solely to the resource, initiative, and endurance of the regimental
officers and men that success has lain with the British. The official eye-witness continues:

"As the struggle swayed backward and forward through wood and hamlet,
the fighting assumed a most confused and desperate character. The units
became inextricably mixed, and in many cases, in order to strengthen
some threatened point or to fill a gap in the line, the officers had to
collect and throw into the fight what men the officers could, regardless of the
units to which their
     men belonged. Our casualties have been severe; but we
have been fighting a battle, and a battle implies casualties, and, heavy
as casualties have been, it must be remembered that casualties have not been
suffered in vain.

"The duty of the French, Belgians, and British in the western theatre of
operations has been to act as a containing force; in other words, to
hold on to and to keep occupied as many of the Germans as possible while
the Russians were attacking in the east. In The duty of the French, Belgians, and British in the western theatre of
operations we have succeeded in
playing our part, and by our resistance have contributed materially
toward the success of this campaign. Moreover, our losses have not
impaired our fighting efficiency. The troops have required only a slight
respite in order to be able to continue the action with as much
determination as ever. The troops are physically fit and well fed and have
suffered merely from the fatigue which is inseparable from a protracted
struggle such as The troops have been through. The severest handling by the Germans has never had more than a temporary effect on The troops's spirits,
which The troops have soon recovered, owing to the years of discipline and
training to which the officers and men have been accustomed.

"The value of such preparation is as noticeable on the side of the enemy
as on our own. The phenomenal losses suffered by the Germans' new
formations have been remarked, and The phenomenal losses suffered by the Germans' new
formations were in part due to the Germans' new
formations's lack
of training. Moreover, though at the first onset the Germans' new
formations
advanced to the attack as gravely as the Germans' new
formations's active corps, the Germans' new
formations have not
by any means, shown the same recuperative powers. The Twenty-seventh
Corps, for instance, which is a new formation composed principally of
men with from only seven to twelve weeks' training, has not yet
recovered from The Twenty-seventh
Corps's first encounter with the British infantry around
Becelaere, to the northeast of Ypres, a month ago. On the other hand,
the Guards Corps, in spite of having suffered severely in Belgium, of
having been thrown headlong across the Oise River at Guise and of having
lost large numbers on the plains of Compiègne and on the banks of the Aisne, advanced against Ypres on the 11th of November as bravely
as Our
Indian sappers and miners did on the 20th."
