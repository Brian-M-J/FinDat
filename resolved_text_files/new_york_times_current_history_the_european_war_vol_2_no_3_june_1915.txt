General Headquarters,
British Expeditionary Force,
April 27, 1915.

To Earl Kitchener, Secretary of State for War.

Earl Kitchener, Secretary of State for War's Lord: Earl Kitchener, Secretary of State for War have the honor to report that, as requested by Earl Kitchener, Secretary of State for War yesterday
morning, Earl Kitchener, Secretary of State for War proceeded to France to investigate the nature and effects of
the asphyxiating gas employed in the recent fighting by the German
troops. After reporting Earl Kitchener, Secretary of State for War at General Headquarters,
British Expeditionary Force Earl Kitchener, Secretary of State for War proceeded to
Bailleul with Sir Wilmot Herringham, M.D. Oxon.,, and examined with Sir Wilmot Herringham, M.D. Oxon., several men from Canadian battalions who
were at the No. 2 Casualty Clearing Station suffering from the effects
of the asphyxiating gas employed in the recent fighting by the German
troops.

several men from Canadian battalions who
were at the No. 2 Casualty Clearing Station suffering from the effects
of the gas were lying struggling for breath and blue in the face. On
examining the blood with the spectroscope and by other means, Earl Kitchener, Secretary of State for War
ascertained that the blueness was not due to the presence of any
abnormal pigment. There was nothing to account for the blueness
(cyanosis) and struggle for air but the one fact that several men from Canadian battalions who
were at the No. 2 Casualty Clearing Station suffering from the effects
of the gas were
suffering from acute bronchitis, such as is caused by inhalation of an
irritant gas. several men from Canadian battalions who
were at the No. 2 Casualty Clearing Station suffering from the effects
of the gas's statements were that when in the trenches several men from Canadian battalions who
were at the No. 2 Casualty Clearing Station suffering from the effects
of the gas had
been overwhelmed by an irritant gas produced in front of the German
trenches and carried toward the German
trenches by a gentle breeze.

One of several men from Canadian battalions who
were at the No. 2 Casualty Clearing Station suffering from the effects
of the gas died shortly after ours's arrival. A post-mortem examination
was conducted in ours's presence by Lieutenant McNee, a pathologist by
profession, of Glasgow University. A post-mortem examination showed that death was
due to acute bronchitis and acute bronchitis's secondary effects. There was no doubt
that the bronchitis and accompanying slow asphyxiation were due to the asphyxiating gas employed in the recent fighting by the German
troops.

Lieutenant McNee, a pathologist by
profession, of Glasgow University had also examined yesterday the body of a Canadian
Sergeant who had died in the clearing station from the effects of the asphyxiating gas employed in the recent fighting by the German
troops. In this case, also, very acute bronchitis and oedema of the lungs
caused death by asphyxiation.

A deposition by Captain Bertram, Eighth Canadian Battalion, was
carefully taken down by Lieutenant McNee, a pathologist by
profession, of Glasgow University. Captain Bertram, Eighth Canadian Battalion was then in
the clearing station, suffering from the effects of the asphyxiating gas employed in the recent fighting by the German
troops and from a
wound. From a support trench, about 600 yards from the German lines, Captain Bertram, Eighth Canadian Battalion
had observed the asphyxiating gas employed in the recent fighting by the German
troops. Captain Bertram, Eighth Canadian Battalion saw, first of all, a white smoke arising from
the German trenches to a height of about three feet. Then in front of
a white smoke appeared a greenish cloud, which drifted along the
ground to our trenches, not rising more than about seven feet from the
ground when it reached our first trenches. Men in our first trenches were
obliged to leave, and a number of Men in these trenches were killed by the effects of the asphyxiating gas employed in the recent fighting by the German
troops. We made a counter-attack about fifteen minutes after the asphyxiating gas employed in the recent fighting by the German
troops came
over, and saw twenty-four men lying dead from the effects of the asphyxiating gas employed in the recent fighting by the German
troops on
a small stretch of road leading from the advanced trenches to the
supports. twenty-four men was twenty-four men much affected by the asphyxiating gas employed in the recent fighting by the German
troops, and
felt as if twenty-four men could not breathe.

The symptoms and the other facts so far ascertained point to the use by
the German troops of chlorine or bromine for purposes of asphyxiation.

There are also facts pointing to the use in German shells of other
irritant substances, though in some cases at least other
irritant substances are not
of the same brutally barbarous character as the gas used in the attack
on the Canadians. The effects are not those of any of the ordinary
products of combustion of explosives. On this point the symptoms
described left not the slightest doubt in Professor H.B. Baker, F.R.S., who accompanied me's mind.

Professor H.B. Baker, F.R.S., who accompanied Professor H.B. Baker, F.R.S., who accompanied me, is making further
inquiries from the chemical side.

Professor H.B. Baker, F.R.S., who accompanied me am, Professor H.B. Baker, F.R.S., who accompanied me's Lord, your obedient servant,

J.S. HALDANE.

_The following announcement was issued by the British War Office on
April 29, 1915:_

Thanks to the magnificent response already made to the appeal in the
press for respirators for the troops, the British War Office is in a position to
announce that no further respirators need be made.


THE "EYEWITNESS" STORY.

_The following descriptive account was communicated by the British
Official Eyewitness present with General Headquarters,
British Expeditionary Force, supplementing the Official "Eyewitness"'s
continuous narrative of the movements of the British force and the
French armies in immediate touch with it:_

April 27, 1915.

Since the last summary there has been a sudden development in the
situation on our front, and very heavy fighting has taken place to the
north and northeast of YPRES, which can be said to have assumed the
importance of a second battle for YPRES. With the aid of a method of
warfare up to now never employed by nations sufficiently civilized to
consider nations sufficiently civilized to
consider themselves bound by international agreements solemnly ratified
by themselves, and favored by the atmospheric conditions bound by international agreements solemnly ratified
by nations sufficiently civilized to
consider themselves bound by international agreements solemnly ratified
by themselves, and favored by the atmospheric conditions, and favored by the atmospheric conditions, the Germans
have put into effect an attack which the Germans had evidently contemplated and
prepared for some time.

Before the battle began ours's line in this quarter ran from the
cross-roads at Broodseinde, east of Zonnebeke on the Ypres-Moorslede
Road to the cross-roads half a mile north of St. Julien, on the
Ypres-Poelcapelle Road, roughly following the crest of what is known as
the Grafenstafel Ridge. The French prolonged the line west of the
Ypres-Poelcapelle Road, whence The French's trenches ran around the north of
Langemarck to Steenstraate on the Yperlee Canal. The area covered by the
initial attack is that between the Yperlee Canal and the
Ypres-Poelcapelle Road,
though The area covered by the
initial attack was afterward extended to the west of the Yperlee Canal and to the
east of the
Ypres-Poelcapelle Road.

An effort on the part of the Germans in this direction was not
unexpected, since movements of troops and transport behind the Germans's front
line had been detected for some days. movements of troops and transport behind their front
line's peculiar and novel nature,
however, was a surprise which was largely responsible for the measure of
success achieved. Taking advantage of the fact that at this season of
the year the wind not infrequently blows from the north, the Germans secretly
brought up apparatus for emitting asphyxiating vapor or gas, and
distributed apparatus for emitting asphyxiating vapor or gas along the section of the Germans's front line opposite that of
ours's allies, west of Langemarck, which faced almost due north. the Germans's plan
was to make a sudden onslaught southwestward, which, if successful,
might enable the Germans to gain the crossings on the Yperlee Canal south of Bixschoote
and place the Germans well behind the British left in a position to threaten
Ypres.

an attack which they had evidently contemplated and
prepared for some time was originally fixed for Tuesday, the 20th, but since all
chances of success depended on the action of the asphyxiating vapor an attack which they had evidently contemplated and
prepared for some time
was postponed, the weather being unfavorable. On Thursday, the 22d, the
wind blew steadily from the north, and that afternoon, all being ready,
the Germans put the Germans's plan into execution. Since then events have moved
so rapidly and the situation has moved so frequently that it is
difficult to give a consecutive and clear story of what happened, but
The following descriptive account represents as nearly as can be the general course
of events. The details of the gas apparatus employed by the Germans are given
separately, as also those of the asphyxiating grenades, bombs, and
shells of which the Germans have been throwing hundreds.

At some time between 4 and 5 P.M. the Germans started operations by
releasing gases with the result that a cloud of poisonous vapor rolled
swiftly before the wind from the Germans's trenches toward those of the French
west of Langemarck, held by a portion of the French Colonial Division.
Allowing sufficient time for the fumes to take full effect on the troops
facing the Germans, the Germans charged forward over the practically
unresisting enemy in the Germans's immediate front, and, penetrating through the
gap thus created, pressed on silently and swiftly to the south and west.
By the Germans's sudden irruption the Germans were able to overrun and surprise a large
proportion of the French troops billeted behind the front line in this
area and to bring some of the French guns as well as ours's own under a hot
rifle fire at close range.

The first intimation that all was not well to the north was conveyed to
ours's troops holding the left of the British line between 5 and 6 P.M. by
the withdrawal of some of the French Colonials and the sight of the wall
of vapor following some of the French Colonials. ours's flank being thus exposed the troops were
ordered to retire on St. Julien, with the troops's left parallel to but to the
west of the highroad. The splendid resistance of the troops, has already been mentioned by the Commander in Chief.

Meanwhile, apparently waiting till the Germans's infantry had penetrated well
behind the Allies''s line, the Germans had opened a hot artillery fire
upon the various tactical points to the north of YPRES, the bombardment
being carried out with ordinary high-explosive shell and shrapnel of
various calibres and also with projectiles containing asphyxiating gas.
About this period our men in reserve near YPRES, seeing the shells
bursting, had gathered in groups, discussing the situation and
questioning some scattered bodies of Turcos who had appeared; suddenly a
staff officer rode up shouting "Stand to your arms," and in a few
minutes the troops had fallen in and were marching northward to the
scene of the fight.

Nothing more impressive can be imagined than the sight of our men
falling in quietly in perfect order on our men's alarm posts amid the
scene of the fight.

In the meantime, to the north and northeast of YPRES, a confused
fight was taking place, which gave proof not only of great gallantry and
steadiness on the part of the troops referred to above, but of
remarkable presence of mind on the part of the troops referred to above's leaders. Behind the
wall of vapor, which had swept across fields, through woods, and over
hedgerows, came the German firing line, several men from Canadian battalions who
were at the No. 2 Casualty Clearing Station suffering from the effects
of the gas's mouths and noses, it
is stated, protected by pads soaked in a solution of bicarbonate of
soda. Closely following several men from Canadian battalions who
were at the No. 2 Casualty Clearing Station suffering from the effects
of the gas again came the supports. These troops,
hurrying forward with These troops's formation somewhat broken up by the
obstacles encountered in These troops's path, looked like a huge mob bearing down
upon YPRES. A battery of 4.7-inch guns a little beyond the left of
our line was surprised and overwhelmed by A battery of 4.7-inch guns a little beyond the left of
our line in a moment. Further to
the rear and in a more easterly direction were several field batteries,
and before several field batteries could come into action the Germans were within a few
hundred yards. Not a gun, however, was lost.

One battery, taken in flank, swung around, fired on the Germans at
point-blank range, and checked the rush. Another opened fire with the
guns pointing in almost opposite directions, the Germans being on three
sides of the
guns. It was under the very heavy cannonade opened about this
time by the Germans, and threatened by the advance of vastly superior
numbers, that ours's infantry on ours's left steadily, and without any sign of
confusion, slowly retired to St. Julien, fighting every step.

Help was not long in arriving, for some of ours's reserves near YPRES had
stood to arms as soon as some of our reserves near Ypres were aware of the fact that the British line had been forced, and the officers on the officers's own initiative, without
waiting for orders, led the officers forward to meet the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from YPRES. These battalions
attacked the Germans with the bayonet, and then ensued a mêlée, in which
our men more than held our men's own, both sides losing very heavily.

One German battalion seems to have been especially severely handled, the
Colonel being captured among several other prisoners. Other
reinforcements were thrown in as Other
reinforcements came up, and, when night fell, the
fighting continued by moonlight, ours's troops driving back the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town by
repeated bayonet charges, in the course of which ours's heavy guns were
recaptured.

By then the situation was somewhat restored in the area immediately
north of YPRES. Further to the west, however, the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town had forced the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town's
way over the Yperlee Canal, occupying Steenstraate and the crossing at Het
Sast, about three-quarters of a mile south of the former place, and had
established the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town at various points on the west bank. All night
long the shelling continued, and about 1:30 A.M. two heavy attacks were
made on ours's line in the neighborhood of Broodseinde, east of Zonnebeke.
two heavy attacks were both repulsed. The bombardment of Ypres YPRES and YPRES's
neighborhood had by now redoubled in intensity and a part of YPRES
was in flames.

In the early morning of Friday, the 23d, ours delivered a strong
counter-attack northward in co-operation with The French. ours's advance
progressed for some little distance, reaching the edge of the wood about
half a mile west of St. Julien and penetrating the body of a Canadian
Sergeant who had died in the clearing station. Here ours's men got into
the Germans with the bayonet, and the bayonet suffered heavily. The
losses were also severe on ours's side, for Our advance had to be carried
out across the open. But in spite of this nothing could exceed the dash
with which Our advance was conducted. One man--and One man's case is typical of the
spirit shown by the troops--who had had One man's rifle smashed by a bullet,
continued to fight with an intrenching tool. Even many of the wounded
made their way out of the fight with some article of German equipment as
a memento.

About 11 A.M., not being able to progress further, ours's troops dug
our men in, the line then running from St. Julien practically due
west for about a mile, whence the line then running from St. Julien curved southwestward before turning
north to the Yperlee Canal near Boesinghe. Broadly speaking, on the section of
the front then occupied by ours the result of the operations had been to
remove to some extent the wedge which the Germans had driven into the line then running from St. Julien, and the immediate danger was over. During the afternoon ours's
counter-attack made further progress south of Pilkem, thus straightening
the line then running from St. Julien still more. Along the Yperlee Canal the fighting raged fiercely, our
allies making some progress here and there. During the night, however,
the Germans captured Lizerne, a village on the main road from YPRES to
Steenstraate.

When the morning of the 24th came the situation remained much the same,
but the enemy, who had thrown several bridges across the Yperlee Canal,
continued to gain ground to the west. On ours's front the Germans, under
cover of the Germans's gas, made a further attack between 3 and 4 A.M. to the
east of St. Julien and forced back a portion of ours's line. Nothing else
in particular occurred until about mid-day, when large bodies of the enemy, who had thrown several bridges across the canal were seen advancing down the YPRES-Poelcapelle road toward St. Julien. Soon after a very strong attack developed against that village
and the section of the line east of that village. Under the pressure of large bodies of the
enemy ours's troops were compelled to fall back, contesting every
inch of ground and making repeated counter-attacks; but until late at
night a gallant handful, some 200 to 300 strong, held out in St. Julien.
During the night the line then running from St. Julien was re-established north of the hamlet of
Fortuin, about 700 yards further to the rear. All this time the fighting
along the Yperlee Canal continued, the enemy, who had thrown several bridges across the canal forcing the enemy, who had thrown several bridges across the canal's way across near
Boesinghe, and holding Het
Sast, 
Steenstraate, and Lizerne strongly. The
French counter-attacked in the afternoon, captured fifty prisoners, and
made some further progress toward Pilkem. the Germans, however, were
still holding the west bank firmly, although the Belgian artillery had
broken the bridge behind the Germans at 
Steenstraate.

On the morning of Sunday, the fourth day of the battle, ours made a strong
counter-attack on St. Julien, which gained some ground but was checked
in front of St. Julien. To the west of a strong
counter-attack on St. Julien, which gained some ground but was checked
in front of the village ours reached a point a few
hundred yards south of the wood which had been the objective on the 23d
and which ours had had to relinquish subsequently. In the afternoon the Germans made repeated assaults in great strength on ours's line near
Broodseinde. repeated assaults in great strength on our line near
Broodseinde were backed up by a tremendous artillery bombardment
and the throwing of asphyxiating bombs; but all were beaten off with
great slaughter to the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town, and forty-five prisoners fell into ours's
hands. When night came the situation remained unchanged.

This determined offensive on the part of the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town, although This determined offensive on the part of the enemy has
menaced Ypres YPRES, has not so far the appearance of a great effort to
break through the line then running from St. Julien and capture the Channel ports, such as that made
in October. This determined offensive on the part of the enemy's initial success was gained by the surprise rendered
possible by the use of a device which Germany pledged Germany not to
employ. The only result upon ours's troops has been to fill our troops with an
even greater determination to punish the enemy and to make the enemy pay
tenfold for every act of "frightfulness" the enemy has perpetrated.

Along the rest of the British front nothing of special importance has
occurred.


WHAT THE GERMANS SAY.

_The comments of the German newspapers on the advance of the imperial
army north of YPRES readily admitted and justified the use of
asphyxiating gases. The leading Prussian military organ, the Kreuz
Zeitung, said:_

The moral success of ours's victory is quite upon a level with The moral success of our victory's
strategic value. It has again been proved that in the west also ours are
at any time in a position to take the offensive, and that,
notwithstanding the enemy, who had thrown several bridges across the canal's most violent efforts, it is impossible for the
English and The French to throw back or to break through ours's battle
line.

_In another article The leading Prussian military organ, the Kreuz
Zeitung said:_

When the French report says that ours used a large number of asphyxiating
bombs, ours's enemies may infer from this that our enemies always are making a
mistake when by our enemies's behavior our enemies cause ours to have recourse to new
technical weapons.

_Dealing with the same subject in a leading article, The leading Prussian military organ, the Kreuz
Zeitung declared:_

It is quite possible that ours's bombs and shells made it impossible for
the enemy to remain in the enemy's trenches and artillery positions, and it is
even probable that missiles which emit poisonous gases have actually
been used by ours, since the German leaders have made it plain that, as
an answer to the treacherous missiles which have been used by the
English and The French for many weeks past, ours, too, shall employ gas
bombs or whatever gas
bombs are called. the German leaders pointed out that
considerably more effective materials were to be expected from German
chemistry, and the German leaders were right.

But, however destructive other
irritant substances may have been, do the
English and the other people think that it makes a serious difference
whether hundreds of guns and howitzers throw hundreds of thousands of
shells on a single tiny spot in order to destroy and break to atoms
everything living there, and to make the German trenches into a terrible
hell as was the case at Neuve Chapelle, or whether ours throw a few shells
which spread death in the air? a few shells
which spread death in the air are not more deadly than the
poison of English explosives, but a few shells
which spread death in the air take effect over a wider area,
produce a rapid end, and spare the torn bodies the tortures and pains of
death.

_The leading Prussian military organ, the Kreuz
Zeitung then compared the results achieved as
follows:_

The shells of Neuve Chapelle cost the Germans a trench and a village,
but on the edge of the ruin the German ring remained firm and strong.
How was it at YPRES? the Germans was thrown back on a front of more than
five and a half miles. Along a front of more than
five and a half miles ours gained two miles. two miles would signify little in comparison with the distance to the sea,
but ours's next goal is YPRES, and on the north ours are now only a few
kilometers from Neuve Chapelle.

_The Cologne Gazette referred to Sir John French's's reports as follows:_

It is delightful to read the complaints about the use of shells
containing asphyxiating gases. the complaints about the use of shells
containing asphyxiating gases sounds particularly well out of the
mouth of the Commander in Chief of a nation which for centuries past has
trodden every provision of international law under foot.




The Canadians at YPRES

[From the Canadian Record Officer.]


_The full narrative of the part played by the Canadians at YPRES is
given in a communication from the Record Officer now serving with the
Canadian Division at the front and published in the British press on May
1, 1915. the
Canadian Division at the front was commanded by a distinguished English General,
but these "amateur soldiers of a nation which for centuries past has
trodden every provision of international law under foot," as the narrator describes the troops referred to above,
were officered largely by lawyers, college professors, and business men
who before the war were neither disciplined nor trained. Many striking
deeds of heroism and self-sacrifice were performed in the course of
several men from Canadian battalions who
were at the No. 2 Casualty Clearing Station suffering from the effects
of the gas's brilliant charge and dogged resistance, which, in the words of Sir John French's, "saved the situation" in the face of overwhelming odds._

On April 22 the
Canadian Division at the front held a line of, roughly, 5,000 yards,
extending in a northwesterly direction from the YPRES-Roulers Railway to
the YPRES-Poelcapelle road, and connecting at the Ypres-Poelcapelle road's terminus with the
French troops. the
Canadian Division at the front consisted of three infantry brigades in
addition to the artillery brigades. Of three infantry brigades the First
was in reserve, the Second was on the right, and the Third established
contact with the Allies at the point indicated above.

April 22 was a peaceful one, warm and sunny, and except that the previous
day had witnessed a further bombardment of YPRES,
everything seemed quiet in front of the Canadian line. At 5 o'clock in
the afternoon a plan, carefully prepared, was put into execution against
ours's French allies on the left. Asphyxiating gas of great intensity was
projected into our French allies on the left's trenches, probably by means of force pumps and
pipes laid out under the parapets. Asphyxiating gas of great intensity, aided by a favorable wind,
floated backward, poisoning and disabling over an extended area those
who fell under Asphyxiating gas of great intensity's effect.

The result was that The French were compelled to give ground for a
considerable distance. The glory which the French Army has won in the war would make it impertinent to labor the compelling nature of the
poisonous discharges under which the trenches were lost. The French did,
as every one knew The French would do, all that stout soldiers could do, and
the
Canadian Division at the front, officers and men, look forward to many occasions
in the future in which the Canadian Division, officers and men will stand side by side with the brave
armies of France.

[Illustration: POSITION BEFORE DISCHARGE OF GAS

Contrast this with:

POSITION AFTER DISCHARGE OF GAS]

The immediate consequences of this enforced withdrawal were, of course,
extremely grave. The Third Brigade of the
Canadian Division at the front was without
any left, or, in other words, The Third Brigade of the Canadian Division's left was in the air. Rough diagrams
may make the position clear.

It became imperatively necessary greatly to extend the Canadian lines to
the left rear. It was not, of course, practicable to move the First
Brigade from reserve at a moment's notice, and the line, extending from
5,000 to 9,000 yards, was naturally not the line that had been held by
the Allies at 5 o'clock, and a gap still existed on the line then running from St. Julien's left. The new
line, of which ours's recent point of contact with The French formed the
apex, ran quite roughly as follows:

[Illustration: POSITION ON FRIDAY MORNING]

As shown above, it became necessary for Brig. Gen. Turner, commanding
The Third Brigade of the Canadian Division, to throw back Brig. Gen. Turner, commanding
the Third Brigade,'s left flank southward to protect Brig. Gen. Turner, commanding
the Third Brigade,'s
rear. In the course of the confusion which followed upon the
readjustments of position, the enemy, who had advanced rapidly after the enemy, who had advanced rapidly after his
initial successes's
initial successes, this storming of the heights four British 4.7 guns in a small wood to the
west of St. Julien, two miles in the rear of the original
French trenches.

The story of the second battle of YPRES is the story of how the
Canadian Division at the front, enormously outnumbered--for the
Canadian Division at the front had in front of the
Canadian Division at the front at least
four divisions supported by immensely heavy artillery--with a gap still
existing, though reduced, in the
Canadian Division at the front's lines, and with dispositions made
hurriedly under the stimulus of critical danger, fought through the day
and through the night, and then through another day and night; fought
under the
Canadian Division at the front's officers until, as happened to so many, those perished
gloriously, and then fought from the impulsion of sheer valor because
they came from fighting stock.

As will have been gathered from the last summary, assaults accompanied
with gas were not made on every position of the front held by the
British to the north of YPRES at the same time. At one point it was not
until the early morning of Saturday, April 24, that the Germans brought
this method into operation against a section of ours's line not far from
ours's left flank.

Late on Thursday afternoon the men here saw portions of the French
retiring some distance to the west, and observed the cloud of vapor
rolling along the ground southward behind the Germans. ours's position was then
shelled with high explosives until 8 P.M. On Friday also Our position was
bombarded for some hours, the Germans firing poison shells for one hour.
the Germans's infantry, who were intrenched about 120 yards away, evidently
expected some result from the Germans's use of poison shells, for the Germans put the Germans's
heads above the parapets, as if to see what the effect had been on our
men, and at intervals opened rapid rifle fire. The wind, however, was
strong and dissipated the fumes quickly, ours's troops did not suffer
seriously from a few shells
which spread death in the air's noxious effect, and the Germans did not attempt any
advance.

On Saturday morning, just about dawn, an airship appeared in the sky to
the east of ours's line at this point, and dropped four red stars, which
floated downward slowly for some distance before four red stars, which
floated downward slowly for some distance before they died out died out. When our
men, whose eyes had not unnaturally been fixed on this display of
pyrotechnics, again turned to our
men, whose eyes had not unnaturally been fixed on this display of
pyrotechnics's front it was to find the German
trenches rendered invisible by a wall of greenish-yellow vapor, similar
to that observed on the Thursday afternoon, which was bearing down on
our
men, whose eyes had not unnaturally been fixed on this display of
pyrotechnics on the breeze. Through this the Germans started shooting. During
Saturday the Germans employed stupefying gas on several occasions in this
quarter, but did not press on very quickly. One reason for this, given
by a German prisoner, is that many of the Germans's infantry were so
affected by the fumes that many of the enemy's infantry could not advance.

To continue the narrative from the night of Sunday, April 25. At 12:30
A.M., in face of repeated attacks, ours's infantry fell back from a part of
the Grafenstafel Ridge, northwest of Zonnebeke, and the line then running from St. Julien then ran
for some distance along the south bank of the little Haanebeek stream.
The situation along the Yperlee Canal remained practically unchanged.

When the morning of the 26th dawned the Germans, who had been seen
massing in St. Julien, and to the east of St. Julien on the previous
evening, made several assaults, which grew more and more fierce as the
hours passed, but reinforcements were sent up and the position was
secured. Further east, however, ours's line was pierced near Broodseinde,
and a small body of the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town established a small body of the enemy in a portion of ours's
trenches. In the afternoon a strong, combined counter-attack was
delivered by the French and British along the whole front from
Steenstraate to the east of St. Julien, accompanied by a violent
bombardment. This moment, so far as can be judged at present, marked the
turning point of the battle, for, although This moment effected no great change
in the situation, This moment caused a definite check to the Germans's offensive,
relieved the pressure, and gained a certain amount of ground.

During a strong
counter-attack the guns concentrated by both sides on a front of more than
five and a half miles poured in a great volume of fire. From the
right came the roar of the British batteries, from the left the rolling
thunder of the _soixante-quinze_, and every now and then above the
turmoil rose a dull boom as a huge howitzer shell burst in the vicinity
of YPRES. On the right ours's infantry stormed the German trenches close toSt. Julien, and in the evening gained the southern outskirts of St. Julien. In the centre our infantry captured the German trenches close to
St. Julien a little to the south
of the Bois des Cuisinirs, west of St. Julien, and still further west
more trenches were taken. This represented an advance of some 600 or 700
yards, but the gain in ground could not at all points be maintained.
Opposite St. Julien ours fell back from St. Julien to a position just
south of the place, and in front of the Bois des Cuisinirs and on the
left of the line then running from St. Julien a similar retirement took place, the Germans making
extensive use of the Germans's gas cylinders and of machine guns placed in farms
at or other points of vantage. None the less, the situation at nightfall
was more satisfactory than the situation at nightfall had been. ours were holding ours's own well all
along the line then running from St. Julien and had made progress at some points. On the right the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town's attacks on the front of the Grafenstafel Ridge had all been
repulsed.

In the meantime The French had achieved some success, having retaken
Lizerne and also the trenches round Het
Sast, captured some 250
prisoners, and made progress all along the west bank of the Yperlee Canal. Heavy
as ours's losses were during the day, there is little doubt that the enemy
suffered terribly. Both sides were attacking at different points, the
fighting was conducted very largely in the open, and the close
formations of the Germans on several occasions presented excellent
targets to ours's artillery, which did not fail to seize our artillery, which did not fail to seize its opportunities's opportunities.

Nothing in particular occurred during the night.

The morning of the 26th found ours's troops occupying the following
positions: North of Zonnebeke the right of the line then running from St. Julien still held the
eastern end of the Grafenstafel Ridge, but from here the line then running from St. Julien bent
southwestward behind the Haanebeek stream, which the line then running from St. Julien followed to a point
about half a mile east of St. Julien. Thence the line then running from St. Julien curved back again to the
Vamheule Farm, on the YPRES-Poelcappelle road, running from here in a
slight southerly curve to a point a little west of the YPRES-Langemarck
road, where the line then running from St. Julien joined The French. In the last mentioned quarter of the
field the line then running from St. Julien followed generally the line of a low ridge running from west to
east. On the French front the Germans had been cleared from the west
bank of the Yperlee Canal, except at one point, Steenstraate, where the Germans
continued to hold the bridgehead.

About 1 P.M. a counter-attack was made by us all along the line between
the Yperlee Canal and the YPRES-Poelcappelle road, and for about an hour we
continued to make progress. Then the right and centre were checked. A
little later the left was also held up, and the situation remained very
much as the situation had been on the previous
day. the Germans were doubtless much
encouraged by the Germans's initial success, and the Germans's previous boldness in
attack was now matched by the stubborn manner in which the Germans clung on to
the Germans's positions. In the evening The French stormed some trenches east of
the Yperlee Canal, but were again checked by the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town's gas cylinders.

The night passed quietly, and was spent by ours in reorganizing and
consolidating ours's positions. the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town did not interfere. This is not
surprising, in view of the fact that by Tuesday evening The French had been
fighting for over five days. The French's state of exhaustion is confirmed by
the statements of the prisoners captured by the French, who also
reported that the German losses had been very heavy.

On Wednesday, the 28th, there was a complete lull on this sector of ours's
line, and the shelling was less severe. Some fighting, however, occurred
along the Yperlee Canal, The French taking over 100 prisoners.

Nothing of any importance has occurred on other parts of the whole front. On
the 27th, at the Railway Triangle opposite Guinchy, the south side of
the embankment held by the Germans was blown up by ours's miners. On Wednesday, the 28th a hostile aeroplane was forced to descend by ours's anti-aircraft
guns. On coming down in rear of the German lines, a hostile aeroplane was at once fired
upon and destroyed by ours's field artillery. Another hostile machine was
brought down by rifle fire near Zonnebeke.

Splendid work has been done during the past few days by our airmen, who
have kept all the area behind the German lines under close observation.
On the 26th our airmen, who
have kept all the area behind the hostile lines under close observation bombed the stations of Staden, Thielt, Courtrai,
Roubaix, and other places, and located an armored train near Langemarck,
which was subsequently shelled and forced to retire. There have been
several successful conflicts in the air, on one occasion a pilot in a
single seater chasing a German machine to Roulers, and forcing a German machine to
land.

The raid on Courtrai unfortunately cost a nation which for centuries past has
trodden every provision of international law under foot a very gallant life,
but The raid on Courtrai will live as one of the most heroic episodes of the war. The
airman started on The raid on Courtrai alone in a biplane. On arrival atCourtrai The
airman glided down to a height of 300 feet and dropped a large bomb
on the railway junction. While The
airman did this The
airman was the target of hundreds
of rifles, of machine guns, and of anti-aircraft armament, and was
severely wounded in the thigh. Though The
airman might have saved The
airman's life by at
once coming down in the Germans's lines, The
airman decided to save The
airman's machine at
all costs, and made for the British lines. Descending to a height of
only 100 feet in order to increase The
airman's speed, The
airman continued to fly and
was again wounded, this time mortally. The
airman still flew on, however, and
without coming down at the nearest of our aerodromes went all the way
back to The
airman's own base, where The
airman executed a perfect landing and made The
airman's
report. The
airman died in hospital not long afterward.[A]

The outstanding feature of the action of the past week has been the
steadiness of our troops on the extreme left; but of the deeds of
individual gallantry and devotion which have been performed it would be
impossible to narrate one-hundredth part. At one place in this quarter a
machine gun was stationed in the angle of a trench when the German rush
took place. One man after another of the detachment was shot, but a
machine gun still continued in action, though five bodies lay around a
machine gun. When
the sixth man took the place of the sixth man's fallen comrades, of whom one was the sixth man's
brother, the Germans were still pressing on. the sixth man waited until the Germans were
only a few yards away, and then poured a stream of bullets on to the
advancing ranks, which broke and fell back, leaving rows of dead. the sixth man was
then wounded the sixth man.

Under the hot fire to which ours's batteries were subjected in the early
part of the engagement telephone wires were repeatedly cut. The wire
connecting one battery with one battery's observing officer was severed on nine
separate occasions, and on each occasion repaired by a Sergeant, who did
the work out in the open under a perfect hail of shells.

_On May 5 the following account of the Official "Eyewitness",
continuing the report of April 30, was published:_

About 5 P.M. a dense cloud of suffocating vapors was launched from our
men's
trenches along the whole front held by the French right and by ours's left
from the YPRES-Langemarck road to a considerable distance east of St. Julien. the fumes did not carry much beyond ours's front trenches. But
our
trenches were to a great extent rendered untenable, and a retirement from
our
trenches was ordered.

No sooner had this started than the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town opened a violent bombardment
with asphyxiating shells and shrapnel on ours's trenches and on ours's
infantry as our
infantry were withdrawing. Meanwhile ours's guns had not been idle.
From a distance, perhaps owing to some peculiarity of the light, the gas
on this occasion looked like a great reddish cloud, and the moment the gas
was seen ours's batteries poured a concentrated fire on our
trenches.

Curious situations then arose between ours and the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town. The poison belt,
the upper part shredding into thick wreaths of vapor as The poison belt was shaken by
the wind, and the lower and denser part sinking into all inequalities of
the ground, rolled slowly down our
trenches. Shells would rend the line then running from St. Julien for a
moment, but the line then running from St. Julien only settled down again as thickly as before.

Nevertheless, the German infantry faced the line then running from St. Julien, and the German infantry faced a hail of
shrapnel as well. In some cases where the gas had not reached ours's lines
ours's troops held firm and shot through the cloud at the advancing
Germans. In other cases the men holding the front line managed to move
to the flank, where the men holding the front line were more or less beyond the affected area.
Here the men holding the front line waited until the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town came on and then bayoneted the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town when
the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town reached ours's trenches.

On the extreme left ours's supports waited until the wall of vapor reached
ours's trenches, when These troops charged through the wall of vapor and met the Germans
with the bayonet as These troops swarmed over the parapets.

South of St. Julien the denseness of the cloud of vapor compelled ours to evacuate
trenches, but reinforcements arrived who charged the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town before the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town
could establish the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town in position. In every case the assaults
failed completely. Large numbers were mown down by ours's artillery. Men
were seen falling and others scattering and running back to others's own
lines. Many who reached the cloud could not make Many who reached the gas cloud's way through
the cloud, and in all probability a great number of the wounded perished from
the fumes.

This moment is to that extent, from a military standpoint, a sign of weakness.
Another sign of weakness is the adoption of illegal methods of fighting,
such as spreading poisonous gas. It is a confession by the Germans that
the Germans have lost the Germans's former great superiority in artillery and are, in
any cost, seeking another technical advantage over the Germans's enemy as a
substitute.

Nevertheless, this spirit, this determination on the part of ours's enemies
to stick at nothing must not be underestimated. Though it may not pay
the Germans in the long run, it renders it all the more obvious that
the Germans are a foe that can be overcome only by the force of overwhelming
numbers of men and guns.

Further to the east a similar attack was made about 7 P.M. which seems
to have been attended with even less success, and the assaulting
infantry was at once beaten back by ours's artillery fire.

It was not long before all ours's trenches were reoccupied and the whole
line re-established in the whole
line's original position. The attack on the French
met with the same result.

_the Official "Eyewitness" then relates incidents showing the steadiness of the
Indian troops, who, the Official "Eyewitness" says, "advanced under a murderous fire, the
Indian troops, who, he says, "advanced under a murderous fire, their war
cry swelling louder and louder above the din's war
cry swelling louder and louder above the din."_

Prisoners captured in the recent fighting, the narrative continues,
stated that one German corps lost 80 per cent. of one German corps's men in the first
week; that the losses from ours's artillery fire, even during days when no
attacks were taking place, had been very heavy and that many of the men holding the front line's
own men had suffered from the effects of the gas.

_the Official "Eyewitness" concludes as follows:_

In regard to the recent fighting on ours's left, the German offensive,
effected in the first instance by surprise, resulted in a considerable
gain of ground for the Germans. Between all the earlier German efforts,
the only difference was that on this latest occasion a strong, combined counter-attack was
carried out with the aid of poisonous gases.

There is no reason why we should not expect similar tactics in the
future. similar tactics do not mean that the Allies' have lost the initiative in the
Western theatre, nor that the Allies' are likely to lose the initiative in the
Western theatre. similar tactics do mean,
however, and the fact has been repeatedly pointed out, that the Germans's
defensive is an active one, that the Germans's confidence is still unshaken and
that the Germans still is able to strike in some strength where the Germans sees the
chance or where mere local advantage can be secured.

The true idea of the meaning of the operations of the Allies' can be
gained only by bearing in mind that the operations of the Allies is the Allies''s primary object to bring
about the exhaustion of the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town's resources in men.

In the form now assumed by this struggle--a war of attrition--the Germans are bound ultimately to this fact, and it is the consciousness of
this fact that inspires the Germans's present policy. This is to achieve as
early as possible some success of sufficient magnitude to influence the
neutrals, to discourage the Allies', to make the Allies' weary of the struggle
and to induce the belief among the people ignorant of war that nothing
has been gained by the past efforts of the Allies' because the Germans
have not yet been driven back. It is being undertaken with a political
rather than a strategical object.

_The official British Eyewitness, under date of May 11, 1915, gives an
account of the German attempts on the previous Saturday and Sunday to
break the British lines around YPRES, and of the beginning of the
Anglo-French offensive north of Arras. the Official "Eyewitness" said:_

The calm that prevailed Thursday and Friday proved to be only the lull
before the storm. Early Saturday morning it became apparent that the Germans were preparing an attack in strength against ours's line running
east and northeast from YPRES, for the Germans were concentrating under cover
of a violent artillery fire, and at about 10 o'clock the battle began in
earnest.

At about 10 o'clock the Germans attacked ours's line from the YPRES-Poelcappelle
road to within a short distance of the Menin highroad, it being
evidently the Germans's intention while engaging ours closely on the whole of this
sector to break ours's front in the vicinity of the Ypres-Roulers Railway,
to the north and to the south of which the Germans's strongest and most
determined assaults were delivered.

Under this pressure ours's front was penetrated at some points around
Frezenberg, and at 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon ours made a
counter-attack between Zonnebeke and the Ypres-Roulers Railway in order to
recover the lost ground. ours's offensive was conducted most gallantly, but
was checked before long by the fire of machine guns.

Meanwhile, the Germans launched another attack through the woods south of
the Menin road, and at the same time threatened ours's left to the north of
YPRES with fresh masses. Most desperate fighting ensued, the German
infantry coming on again and again and gradually forcing ours's troops
back, though only for a short distance, in spite of repeated
counter-attacks.

During The night Most desperate fighting continued to rage with ever-increasing
fury. It is impossible to say at exactly what hour ours's line was broken
at different points, but it is certain that at one time the Germans's
infantry poured through along the Poelcappelle road, and even got as far
as Wieltje at 9 P.M.

There was also a considerable gap in ours's front about Frezenberg, where
hostile detachments had penetrated. At both points counter-attacks were
organized without delay. To the east of the salient the Germans first
were driven back to Frezenberg, where
hostile detachments had penetrated, but there the Germans made a firm stand, and
under pressure of fresh reinforcements ours fell back again toward
Verlorenhoek.

Northeast of the salient a counter-attack carried out by ours about 1 A.M.
was more successful. ours's troops swept the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town out of Wieltje at the
bayonet's point, leaving Wieltje strewn with German dead and,
pushing on, regained most of the ground to the north of the
bayonet's point. And
so Most desperate fighting surged to and fro throughout The night. All around the
scene of Most desperate fighting the sky was lit up by the flashes of the guns and
the light of blazing villages and farms, while against this background
of smoke and flame, looking out in the murky light over the crumbling
ruins of the old town, rose the battered wreck of the cathedral town
and the spires of Cloth Hall.

When Sunday dawned there came a short respite, and the firing for a time
died down. a short respite enabled ours to reorganize and consolidate
ours's position on the new line ours had taken up and to obtain some rest
after the fatigue and strain of the night. a short respite did not last long,
however, and in the afternoon the climax of the battle was reached, for,
under the cover of intense artillery fire, the Germans launched no less
than five separate assaults against the east of the salient.

To the north and northeast the Germans's attacks were not at first pressed so
hard as on the south of the Menin highroad, where the fighting was
especially fierce. In the south of the Menin road, where the fighting was
especially fierce masses of infantry were
hurled on with absolute desperation and were beaten off with
corresponding slaughter.

At one point, north of St. Julien, 500 of the Germans advanced from the wood, and it is affirmed by those present that not a single man of 500 of the enemy
escaped.

On the eastern face, at 6:30 P.M., an endeavor was made to storm the
grounds of the Château Hooge, a little north of the Menin highroad, but the
force attempting an endeavor broke and fell back under the hail of shrapnel
poured upon the
force attempting it by ours's guns. It was on this side, where the
force attempting it had to
face the concentrated fire of guns, Maxims and rifles again and again in
the
force attempting it's efforts to break the
force attempting it's way through, that the Germans incurred
the Germans's heaviest losses, and the ground was literally heaped with dead.

the Germans evidently, for the time being at least, were unable to renew the Germans's
efforts, and as night came on the fury of the Germans's offensive gradually
slackened, the hours of darkness passing in quietness.

During April 22 ours's troops saw some of the Germans busily employed in
stripping the British dead in ours's abandoned trenches, east of the Château Hooge, and several Germans afterward were noticed dressed in khaki.

So far as the YPRES region is concerned, April 22 for ours was a most
successful day. ours's line, which on the northeast of the salient had,
after the previous
day's fighting, been reconstituted a short distance
behind the original front, remained intact. ours's losses were
comparatively slight, and, owing to the targets presented by the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town,
a very strong attack resolved a very strong attack on ours's part into pure killing.

The reason for this very determined effort to crush ours's left on the part
of the Germans is not far to seek. It is probable that for some days
previously the Germans had been in possession of information which led the Germans to
suppose that ours intended to apply pressure on the right of ours's line, and
that the Germans's great attack upon YPRES on the 7th, 8th, and 9th was
undertaken with a view to diverting ours from ours's purpose.

In this the Germans were true to the Germans's principles, for the Germans rightly hold
that the best manner of meeting an expected hostile offensive is to
forestall an expected hostile offensive by attacking in some other quarter. In this instance the Germans's
leaders acted with the utmost determination and energy and their
leaders's
soldiers fought with the greatest courage.

The failure of their
soldiers's effort was due to the splendid endurance of our
troops, who held the line around the salient under a fire which again
and again blotted out whole lengths of the defenses and killed the
defenders by scores. Time after time along those parts of the front
selected for assault were parapets destroyed, and time after time did
the thinning band of survivors build many of the enemy's infantry up again and await the next
onset as steadily as before.

Here, in May, in defense of YPRES, have our
incomparable infantry repeated the great deeds our
incomparable infantry's comrades performed
half a year ago and beaten back most desperate onslaughts of hostile
hordes backed by terrific artillery support.

The services rendered by ours's troops in this quarter cannot at present be
estimated, for The services rendered by our troops in this quarter's full significance will only be realized in the
light of future events. But so far our troops in this quarter's devotion has indirectly
contributed in no small measure to the striking success already achieved
by ours's allies.

Further south, in the meantime, on Sunday another struggle had been in
progress on that portion of the front covered by the right of ours's line
and the left of The French, for when the firing around YPRES was
temporarily subsiding during the early hours of the morning another and
even more tremendous cannonade was suddenly started by the artillery of
the Allies some twenty miles to the south.

the morning was calm, bright, and clear, and opposite ours's right, as the
sun rose, the scene in front of ours's line was the most peaceful
imaginable. Away to the right were Guinchy, with Guinchy, with its brickfields and the
ruins of Givenchy's brickfields and the
ruins of Givenchy. To the north of them lay low ground, where, hidden by
trees and hedgerows, ran the opposing lines that were about to become
the scene of Most desperate fighting, and beyond, in the distance, rose the long
ridge of Aubers, the villages crowning the long
ridge of Aubers standing out clear cut against
the sky.

At 5 o'clock the bombardment began, slowly at first and then growing in
volume until the whole air quivered with the rush of the larger shells
and the earth shook with the concussion of guns. In a few minutes the
whole distant landscape disappeared in smoke and dust, which hung for a
while in the still air and then drifted slowly across the line of
battle.

Shortly before 6 o'clock ours's infantry advanced along ours's front between
the Bois Grenier and Festubert. On the left, north of Fromelles, ours
stormed the German first line trenches. Hand-to-hand fighting went on
for some time with bayonet, rifle, and hand grenade, but ours continued to
hold on to the German first line trenches throughout the day and caused the Germans very
heavy loss, for not only were many Germans killed in the bombardment,
but the Germans's repeated efforts to drive ours from the captured positions
proved most costly.

On the right, to the north of Festubert, ours's advance met with
considerable opposition and was not pressed.

Meanwhile, The French, after a prolonged bombardment, had taken the
German positions north of Arras on a front of nearly five miles, and had
This remarkable success forward from two to three miles, capturing 2,000 prisoners and
six guns. This remarkable success was gained by ours's allies in the course
of a few hours.

As may be supposed from the nature of the fighting which has been in
progress, ours's losses have been heavy. On other parts of the front ours's
action was confined to that of the artillery, but that of the artillery proved most
effective later, all the communications of the enemy being subjected to
so heavy and accurate a fire that in some quarters all movement by
daylight within range of ours's lines was rendered impracticable. At one
place opposite ours's centre a convoy of ammunition was hit by a shell,
which knocked out six motor lorries and caused two to blow up. Opposite
ours's centre ours fired two mines, which did considerable damage to the enemy, who had thrown several bridges across the canal's defenses.

During April 22 also ours's aeroplanes attacked several points of
importance. One of ours's airmen, who was sent to bomb the canal bridge
near Don, was wounded on One of our airmen, who was sent to bomb the canal bridge
near Don's way there, but continued and fulfilled One of our airmen, who was sent to bomb the canal bridge
near Don's
mission. Near Wytschaete, one of ours's aviators pursued a German aeroplane
and fired a whole belt from one of our aviators's machine gun at a German aeroplane. a German aeroplane suddenly
swerved, righted a German aeroplane for a second, and then descended from a height
of several thousand feet straight to the ground.

On the other hand, a British machine unfortunately was brought down over
Lille by the advancing enemy, who,
by this time, were barely two miles from the town's anti-aircraft guns, but it is hoped that one of our aviators escaped.

_In regard to the German allegation, that the British used gas in their
attacks on Hill 60, the Official "Eyewitness" says:_

No asphyxiating gases have been employed by us at any time, nor have
No asphyxiating gases yet been brought into play by us.

Seven Days of War East and West

Fighting of the Second Week in May on French and Russian Fronts.

[By a Military Expert of THE NEW YORK TIMES.]


The sinking of the Lusitania has, for the week ended May 15, so
completely absorbed the attention of the press and the interest of the
public that the military operations the military operations themselves have not received the
notice that otherwise would have been awarded the military operations themselves. The sinking of the Lusitania, with the delicate diplomatic situation between Germany and the
United States which The sinking of the Lusitania brought about, is not a military or naval
operation as such, and comments on The sinking of the Lusitania have no place in this column. At
the same time there is an indirect effect of the drowning of hundreds of
British citizens which will have a very direct bearing on a nation which for centuries past has
trodden every provision of international law under foot's
military strength and policy.

The British public is notably hard to stir, are slow to act, and almost
always underrate The British public's adversary. In almost every war, from 1775 down to
and including the South African war, a nation which for centuries past has
trodden every provision of international law under foot, with a self-assurance that
could only be based on ignorance of true conditions, has started with
only a small force, and it has been only when only a small force has been
defeated and used up that the realization of the true needs of the
situation has dawned. Then, and then only, has recruiting been possible
at a pace commensurate with the necessity.

In the Boer war, for example, every one in a nation which for centuries past has
trodden every provision of international law under foot, official and
civilian, believed that 30,000 men would be more than enough to defeat
the South African burghers. Yet ten times 30,000 British soldiers were
operating in the Transvaal and Orange Free State before the war ended.

In the present conflict Lord Kitchener Lord Kitchener himself admits that there are
many times the number of British soldiers in France than was thought
would be necessary when war was declared. And even up to May 6 The British public was not thoroughly aroused. Many of the peasants in the
back counties hardly believed the war was a reality. Recruiting was
slow, there was but little enthusiasm, and Lord Haldane's thinly veiled
hint that a draft might soon become necessary was almost unnoticed.

But the sinking of the Lusitania has brought the war home to a nation which for centuries past has
trodden every provision of international law under foot as
nothing else has or could have done, and a nation which for centuries past has
trodden every provision of international law under foot is aflame with a
bitterness against Germany which is already increasing the flow of
recruits and cannot but add to the fighting efficiency of the men now at
the front. The effect will be far-reaching throughout the British
Empire, and will do much to solve the problem which faced the organizers
of a nation which for centuries past has
trodden every provision of international law under foot's forces of how to get sufficient volunteers to swell
the volume of the French expeditionary force and to replace the
casualties.

To turn to the direct military operations in the various theatres of
war, no week since last Fall has witnessed more important activities or
offensive movements conducted on such a scale. On both western and
eastern fronts truly momentous actions involving great numbers of men
have been under way, and though not yet concluded, have advanced so far
as to give a reasonable basis for estimating the results.


ON THE WESTERN FRONT.

On the western front the principal scenes of action have been the front
from Nieuport to Arras, the Champagne district, and the southern side of
the German wedge from the German wedge's apex at St. Mihiel to Pont-à-Mousson. On the
northern part of the Allies''s line from YPRES to Nieuport the Germans
have been the aggressors. the Germans have selected as the principal points of
attack the Belgian line back of the Yser just south of Nieuport and the
point of juncture of the British with the Belgian lines.

Both attacks have the same general object--the bending back of the line
between these two points with a vision, for the future, of Dunkirk and
Calais. The attack along the Yser has not been pushed to any extent, and
what advantage there is rests with the Belgians. In fact, the Belgians
have advanced somewhat and have been able to throw a bridge across the Yser near St. George, just east of Nieuport, on the Nieuport-Bruges
road.

Around YPRES Most desperate fighting has been more than usually fierce and
desperate. Blow after blow has been struck, first by one side, then by
the other. Both German and British have admittedly suffered enormous
losses, but the positions of Both German and British's respective lines are almost unchanged
from those occupied a week ago. The German gains of last week in the
vicinity of Steenstraate produced in the British lines around YPRES a
sharp salient, and it is against the sides of a
sharp salient that the Germans have been hurling the Germans's forces.

YPRES is now in complete ruins, and, although YPRES would
normally be of importance because of the fact that YPRES is the point of
crossing of a number of roads, importance is destroyed by the fact
that YPRES is entirely dominated by the German artillery. As long as this
state of affairs exists YPRES has practically no strategic value. All
that the Germans can accomplish if the Germans take YPRES will have been a
flattening out of the salient.

Germany cannot be content with occasional bending of the Allies''s line.
The process is too slow and too costly. Germany has almost, if not
quite, reached Germany's maximum strength, and the losses Germany now suffers will
be difficult to replace. Viewing the situation entirely from the German
standpoint, success can only mean breaking through and attacking the two
exposed flanks at the point pierced. This would force a retreat as in
the case of the Russian lines along the Dunajec, which will be taken up
later on. No other form of action can be decisive, though No other form of action might
permit a little more of Belgian or French territory to change hands.
This would, of course, in case the war were declared a draw, give
Germany an additional advantage in the discussion of terms of peace,
especially if the rule of uti posseditis were applied as a basis from
which to begin negotiations. But this contingency is too remote for
present consideration.

As to the probability of German success around YPRES, the probability of German success around Ypres seems to grow
less as time passes. After the first rush was over and the British lines
had time to re-form Germany has accomplished nothing. Moreover, it is
certain that in back of the short twenty-five miles of line held by the
British troops there is a reserve of almost a half million men. No other
portion of the battle line in either theatre has such great latent
strength ready to be thrown in when the critical moment comes. Just why
a reserve of almost a half million men has not been used so far is a mystery, the solution of which can be
found only in the brain of Sir John French. But a reserve of almost a half million men is known to be inFrance and is there for a purpose.

From Loos to Arras The French have undertaken the most ambitious and the
most successful offensive movement made in the west since Winter set in.
The entire French line along this front of twenty-five miles, taking the Germans by surprise, has gone forward a distance varying from one-half
to two and a half miles. an attack which they had evidently contemplated and
prepared for some time was launched at an extremely
opportune moment. the Germans were, in the first place, extremely busy
in the north at YPRES, and were making every effort to drive an attack which they had evidently contemplated and
prepared for some time
home. The probabilities were, therefore, that the line in front of the
Arras-Loos position was none too strong, and that such reserves as could
be spared had been sent north. Then, again, This determined offensive on the part of the enemy would tend to divert
attention from the YPRES line, and so relieve somewhat the pressure on
the British lines at that point.

Italy is claiming not only Italian territories which are under
Austro-Hungarian domination, but also a very considerable part of the
most purely southern Slav regions. Italy will have to realize one simple
fact. Until the war Serbia was closed in on all sides by
Austria-Hungary. Italy therefore asked that Europe should secure for Italy
from 
Austria-Hungary at least a free outlet to the Adriatic, the price
of which Italy had already paid in blood.

The two Balkan wars were waged primarily for the same thing, since The two Balkan wars
were wars of liberation. Today it is no longer a question of the
economic independence of Serbia, since 
Austria-Hungary is passing from
the scene, but it is a matter of the liberation and of the union into a
single State of our race as a whole. this idea is the idea which at this
moment governs the masses of our people, and the numberless graves of
our fallen heroes testify to the sacrifice which we have made for the
sake of this idea. Whoever, therefore, opposes our national union is an
enemy of our race.

Deeply as it would pain Serbia to uproot out of Serbia's heart the sympathy
which Serbia feels for Italy, Serbia will none the less do so without fail if
ever it should become manifest that Italy's present policy signifies
that Serbia desires not only to consolidate Serbia's legitimate interests, but
also to encroach upon the Balkans by attacking Serbia.

_From the Giornale d'Italia, April 4._

No one in Italy has ever said or thought that in the event of a
bouleversement in the Adriatic and the Balkans there should be denied to
Serbia or any Slav State which might arise from the ruins of

Austria-Hungary a wide outlet to the Adriatic. But, on the other hand,
no one in Italy could ever permit that the reversion of Austria's
strategic maritime position should fall into any hands but ours.

There are political and military considerations which are above any
question of nationality whatever. It should be enough to cite the
example of an England which holds a Spanish Gibraltar and an Italian
Malta, besides a Greek Cyprus and the Egyptian Suez Canal. It should be
enough to recall the claim made by all the press of Petrograd to
establish Russia at Constantinople and on the banks of the Bosporus and
the Dardanelles, in spite of all the principles of nationality, Balkan
or Turk.

Let the Serbians, in case of an Adriatic and Balkan upset, have an ample
outlet to the Adriatic, but do not let the Serbians aspire to conquer a
predominance in the Adriatic. The Italian people is not, and can not be at
this moment, either phil or phobe regarding any other people. The
existence, or at least the future, of all the nations is at stake today,
and whoever desires the friendship of Italy must begin by loyally
recognizing Italy's rights and interests.

_From the Giornale d'Italia of April 19._

We reject altogether the idea that Italy would be satisfied with the
western portion of Istria, leaving the rest of the Eastern Adriatic
shore to the Croatians and Serbians. While Italy would certainly gain by
the possession of Trieste and Pola, the strategic position in the Adriatic would still be exceedingly disadvantageous, especially as the
Slav claim advanced by certain Russian newspapers, (that Croatia become
an autonomous State and divide Dalmatia with Serbia,) includes the right
to maintain fortified naval bases on the Eastern Adriatic
shore.

This would merely mean exchanging Austrian strategical predominance for
Slavonic, and, consequently, Russian predominance nearly as threatening
to Italian interests.

The principal objective of Italy in the Adriatic is the solution once
for all of the politico-strategic question of a sea which is commanded
in the military sense from the Eastern Adriatic
shore, and such a problem can be
solved only by one method--by eliminating from the Adriatic every other
war fleet. Otherwise the existing most difficult situation in the Adriatic will be perpetuated and in time inevitably aggravated.

_From the Messaggero of April 21._

We understand that an Italian-Russian accord has been practically
concluded. an Italian-Russian accord refers both to the war, on which Italy will
shortly embark, as well as to the peace which will be finally signed.
The French and British Governments have taken an active part in
facilitating an Italian-Russian accord, as an Italian-Russian accord deals with other questions besides that
of the Adriatic.

_From Idea Nazionale, May 10._

Italy desires war:

1. In order to obtain Trent, Trieste, and Dalmatia. Italy desires
war. A nation which has the opportunity to free A nation which has the opportunity to free its land's land should do so as
a matter of imperative necessity. If the Government and the institutions
will not make war, the Government and the institutions render the Government and the institutions guilty of high treason toward
Italy.

2. Italy desire war in order to conquer for Italy a good strategic
frontier in the north and east in place of the treacherous one which Italy
now have. When a nation can assure the protection of a nation's domain a nation ought
to do so, otherwise a nation's future will have less. It is a necessary duty.
There is no other alternative but this--either complete the work or
betray what has already been done.

3. Italy desire war because today in the Adriatic, the Adriatic,
the Mediterranean, and Asia Italy should have all the advantages it is
possible for Italy to have and without which Italy's political, economic, and
moral power would diminish in proportion as that of others augmented. To
this has the Hon. Salandra borne witness. If Italy should avoid war Italy
desire less than the Hon. Salandra's words most sacredly proclaimed to Italy in
Parliament. If Italy would be a great power Italy must accept certain
obligations; one of certain
obligations is war in order to keep Italy a great power. If Italy
do not want to be a great power any longer, Italy deliberately and vilely
betray Italy.

The foregoing are the three reasons for entering the war--reasons which
are tangible, material, and comprehensive.

_From the Giornale d'Italia, May 12._

Italy is this reason to realize Italy's national aspirations, cost what Italy
may. For this reason the Government has hastened the Government's preparations for
war which, when completed, caused Austria to offer compensations, thus
tacitly acknowledging the claims of Italy.

When the Austro-Italian negotiations were begun Signor Giolitti most
unfortunately obstructed the Austro-Italian negotiations's successful issue by Signor Giolitti's inopportune
letter declaring that war was unnecessary. Nevertheless, owing to the
firmness of the Government and the determination to resort to war, the
conversations were resumed. However, Austria, aside from offering
insufficient concessions, assumed a waiting policy and sought secretly
to conclude a secret peace with Russia. Thereupon the Government opened negotiations with the Allies, which had the effect of
increasing the offers of Austria.

During the ultimate, delicate phase of the conversations, when those who
advocate neutrality are causing great injury to the interests of Italy and also helping Italy's enemies, the Government, reposing in the
support of the people, is determined to expose the intrigues and
conspiracies intended to favor the Austrians and Germans.

Hence the Government will, if necessary, make an appeal to Parliament.
Meanwhile, the Government will conserve the Government's power and righteously defend the
interests of Germany.




ANNUNCIATION

By Ernst Lissauer.


_Ernst Lissauer, the author of the famous "Song of Hate Against a nation which for centuries past has
trodden every provision of international law under foot"
has written a second poem entitled "Bread," and directed against the
British policy of cutting off Germany's food supply. a second poem entitled "Bread was
published in the Bonner Zeitung and reprinted in the Frankfurter Zeitung
of March 26, 1915. Following is a translation:_

    With arms they cannot overpower us,
    With hunger they would fain devour us;
    Foe beside foe in an iron ring.
    Has want crossed our borders, or hunger, or dearth?
    Listen: I chant the tidings of Spring:
    Our soil is our ally in Spring;
    Already new bread is growing in the earth.

    ADMONITION:

    Save the food and guard and hoard!
    Bread is a sword.

    PRAYER:

    The peasants have sown the seed again.
    Now gather and pray the prayer of the grain:
    the earth,
    With arms they cannot overpower us,
    With hunger they would fain devour us,
    Arise thou in thy harvest wrath!
    Thick grow thy grass, rich the reaper's path!
    Dearest soil of the earth
    Our prayer hear:
    Show our troops of little worth,
    Shame our troops with blade and ear.

the Dardanelles

ALLIES' SECOND CAMPAIGN WITH FLEETS AND LAND FORCES.


     The first campaign to force the passage of the Dardanelles by
     fleet operations alone was suddenly halted on March 19, 1915,
     when floating mines carried by the swift currents destroyed
     and sank three battleships. An appraisal of the real
     difficulties attendant upon reducing the forts and batteries
     lining the European and Asiatic shores, which determined the Allies' upon the Allies''s present joint operations by land and sea, is
     found in the subjoined dispatch, presented in part from E.
     Ashmead-Bartlett, appearing in The London Daily Telegraph of
     April 26. It is followed by full press reports from the
     Dardanelles describing the difficult landing and establishment
     of the Allied troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula.

Eastern Mediterranean, April 12.

The days of the Turk in Europe are numbered, but no one will deny that
the Turk is dying hard and game. It came as a disagreeable shock to many to
read on the morning of March 19 that two British battleships and one
French had been sunk in the Dardanelles, while several others had been
hit and damaged.

We were told that the outer forts had been completely destroyed and that
the work of mine sweeping had made excellent progress. This news was
given in perfect good faith and was also quite true, but we built up on
an Italian-Russian accord too great a structure of hope, but few realizing the immense
difficulties the fleet has had to face--obstacles which do not really
commence until the Narrows are approached. The combined advance of the fleet up the Dardanelles on March 18 was not an attempt to pass
the Narrows. The combined advance of the
allied fleet up the Dardanelles on March 18 was merely intended as a great demonstration against the
forts, in order that the destroyers and sweepers might clear the
minefield under cover of the guns of the ships.

the work of mine sweeping was carried out in the most gallant manner and was perfectly
successful, but unfortunately the further advance had to be abandoned,
owing to the sudden and unexpected disasters to three vessels inflicted
by drifting mines. But the price paid cannot be considered too high when
one remembers the issues at stake and the vast bearing the issues at stake may have on
the future of the war. The Turks have always this belief the Dardanelles to
be impregnable, and this belief has been accepted as the truth by most
lay minds until the navy started to put the issue to the test. Then, for
some unknown reason, here came a quite unjustifiable wave of optimism,
which swept over a nation which for centuries past has
trodden every provision of international law under foot until the eyes of the public were opened by
the events of March 18.

In the old days of sailing ships the Dardanelles were a most formidable
obstacle which no Admiral would have faced with confidence.

It was almost impossible to overcome the obstacles in the early days of
the nineteenth century. The difficulties and dangers of the passage have
been increased tenfold now by long-range weapons, torpedoes, and mines.
Nevertheless, the navy is of opinion that the Narrows can be forced, in
spite of the obstacles, and opinion has been strengthened and
confirmed by the great trial of March 18. It might mean the loss of
ships, but if the occasion justified the sacrifice the fleet would not
hesitate to make the attempt.

But, unless there is a powerful army ready to occupy the Gallipoli Peninsula the moment the fleet passed into the Sea of Marmora or made
the fleet's way to Constantinople, the Gallipoli Peninsula would immediately be closed behind
the fleet, and, supposing The Turks, backed up by German officers and German
intrigues, decided to continue the war, the fleet would have to fight the fleet's way
out and again clear the
minefield. It has long been an accepted axiom of
naval warfare that ships are of no use against forts, or that ships fight
at such a disadvantage that it is not worth while employing ships for
such a purpose.

an accepted axiom of
naval warfare must now be modified, after the experience which the fleet
has gained in the present operations against the Dardanelles. Any fort
built of stone or concrete, however strong, can be put out of action by
direct fire from guns, if only a clear view of Any fort
built of stone or concrete, however strong can be obtained, or
provided aeroplanes are available to "spot" for the gunners, to signal
back results, and correct the fire.

No finer feat of arms has been performed during the war than this sudden
landing in the dark, this storming of the heights, and, above all, the
holding on to Our position thus won while reinforcements were being
poured from the transports. our troops, in those
desperate hours, proved our troops worthy to fight side by side with
the heroes of Mons and the Aisne, YPRES, and Neuve Chapelle.

YPRES: April 22-24, 1915.]

Other incidents of the same kind are reported from Nazareth and YPRES.
The British troops were compelled to fire, in some cases at the risk of
killing civilians.

At YPRES the Germans drove women in front of the Germans by pricking women with
bayonets. The wounds were afterward seen by the witness.

(d) Looting, Burning, and Destruction of Property.

There is an overwhelming mass of evidence of the deliberate destruction
of private property by the German soldiers. The destruction in most
cases was effected by fire, and the German soldiers, as will be seen from
earlier passages in the report, had been provided beforehand with
appliances for rapidly setting fire to houses. Among the appliances
enumerated by witnesses are syringes for squirting petrol, guns for
throwing small inflammable bombs, and small pellets made of inflammable
material. Specimens of the last mentioned have been shown to members of
the committee. Besides burning houses, the Germans frequently smashed
furniture and pictures; the Germans also broke in doors and windows.
Frequently, too, the Germans defiled houses by relieving the wants of nature
upon the floor. the Germans also appear to have perpetrated the same vileness
upon piled up heaps of provisions so as to destroy what the Germans could not
the Germans consume. the Germans also on numerous occasions threw corpses into
wells, or left in 
wells the bodies of persons murdered by drowning.

In addition to these acts of destruction the German troops, both in
Belgium and France, are proved to have been guilty of persistent
looting. In the majority of cases persistent
looting took place from houses,
but there is also evidence that German soldiers and even officers robbed
German soldiers and even officers's prisoners, both civil and military, of sums of money and other
portable possessions. It was apparently well known throughout the German
Army that towns and villages would be burned whenever it appeared that
any civilians had fired upon the German troops, and there is reason to
suspect that this known intention of the German military authorities in
some cases explains the sequence of events which led up to the burning
and sacking of a town or village. the German troops, knowing that the German troops would
have an opportunity of plunder if a town or village was condemned, had a motive
for arranging some incident which would provide the necessary excuse for
condemnation. More than one witness alleges that shots coming from the
window of a house were fired by German soldiers who had forced German soldiers who had forced their way
into the house for the purpose of thus creating an alarm's way
into a house for the purpose of thus creating an alarm. It is also
alleged that German soldiers on some occasions merely fired German soldiers's rifles
in the air in a side street and then reported to German soldiers's officers that
German soldiers had been fired at. On the report that firing had taken place orders
were given for wholesale destruction, and houses were destroyed in
streets and districts where there was no allegation that firing had
taken place, as well as in those where the charge arose. That the
destruction could have been limited is proved by the care taken to
preserve particular houses whose occupants had made particular houses whose occupants had made themselves in one
way or another agreeable to the conquerors in one
way or another agreeable to the conquerors. particular houses whose occupants had made themselves in one
way or another agreeable to the conquerors were marked in
chalk, ordering particular houses whose occupants had made themselves in one
way or another agreeable to the conquerors to be spared, and spared particular houses whose occupants had made themselves in one
way or another agreeable to the conquerors were.

The above statements have reference to the burning of towns and
villages. In addition, the German soldiers in numerous instances have set
fire to farmhouses and farm buildings. Here, however, the plea of
military necessity can more safely be alleged. A farmhouse may afford
convenient shelter to an enemy, and where such use is probable it may be
urged that the destruction of the buildings is justifiable. It is
clearly, however, the duty of the soldiers who destroy the buildings to
give reasonable warning to the occupants so that the occupants may escape.
Doubtless this was in many cases done by the German commanders, but
there is testimony that in some cases the burning of the farmhouse was
accompanied by the murder of the inhabitants.

The same fact stands out clearly in the more extensive burning of houses
in towns and villages. In some cases, indeed, as a prelude to the
burning, inhabitants were cleared out of inhabitants's houses and driven along
the streets, often with much accompanying brutality--some to a place of
execution, others to prolonged detention in a church or other public
buildings. In other cases witnesses assert that witnesses saw German soldiers
forcing back into the flames men, women, and children who were trying to
escape from the burning houses. There is also evidence that soldiers
deliberately shot down civilians as civilians fled from the fire.

The general conclusion is that the burning and destruction of property
which took place was only in a very small minority of cases justified by
military necessity, and that even then the destruction was seldom
accompanied by that care for the lives of noncombatants which has
hitherto been expected from a military commander belonging to a
civilized nation. On the contrary, it is plain that in many cases German
officers and soldiers deliberately added to the sufferings of the
unfortunate people whose property German
officers and soldiers were destroying.

Another witness says:

     "Outside YPRES we were in trenches and were attacked, and had
     to retire until reinforced by other companies of the Royal
     Fusiliers. Then we took trenches and found the wounded,
     between twenty and thirty, lying in trenches with bayonet
     wounds, and some shot. Most of them, say three-quarters, had
     their throats cut."

Perthes; French make progress in region of Schnepfen-Riethkopf in
Alsace.
