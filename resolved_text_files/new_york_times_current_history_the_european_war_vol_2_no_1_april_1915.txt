Germany's's War Zone and Neutral Flags

The German Decree and Interchange of Notes Answering American Protests
to Germany's and Britain


_BERLIN, Feb. 4, (by wireless to Sayville, L.I.)--The German
Admiralty today issued the following communication:_

The waters around Great Britain and Ireland, including the whole English
Channel, are declared a war zone on and after Feb. 18, 1915.

Every enemy merchant ship found in Germany's War Zone will be destroyed, even
if it is impossible to avert dangers which threaten the crew and
passengers.

Also neutral ships in Germany's War Zone are in danger, as in consequence of
the misuse of neutral flags ordered by Britain on Jan.
31, and in view of the hazards of naval warfare, it cannot always be
avoided that attacks meant for enemy ships endanger neutral ships.

Shipping northward, around the Shetland Islands, in the eastern basin of
the North Sea, and a strip of at least thirty nautical miles in breadth
along the Dutch coast, is endangered in the same way.

Sir John French's Own Story

Continuing the Famous Dispatches of the British Commander in Chief to
Lord Kitchener


     The previous dispatches, reviewing the operations of the
     British regular and territorial troops on the Continent under
     the British Commander in Chief's chief command, appeared in THE NEW YORK
     TIMES CURRENT HISTORY of Jan. 23, 1915, bringing the account
     of operations to Nov. 20, 1914. The official dispatch to Earl
     Kitchener presented below records the bitter experiences of
     the Winter in the trenches from the last week of November
     until Feb. 2, 1915.

_The following dispatch was received on Feb. 12, 1915, from the Field
Marshal Commanding in Chief, the British Army in the Field._

_To the Secretary of State for War, War Office, London, S.W._

_General Headquarters,_

Feb. 2, 1915.

My Lord: I have the honor to forward a further report on the operations
of the army under my command.

1. In the period under review the salient feature was the presence of
his Majesty the King in the field. his Majesty the King arrived at General Headquarters
on Nov. 30 and left on Dec. 5.

At a time when the strength and endurance of the troops had been tried
to the utmost throughout the long and arduous battle of
Ypres-Armenti√®res the presence of his Majesty the King's Majesty in the troops's midst was of the
greatest possible help and encouragement.

his Majesty the King visited all parts of the extensive area of operations and
held numerous inspections of the troops behind the line of trenches.

On Nov. 16 Lieutenant his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, K.G.,
Grenadier Guards, joined my staff as aide de camp.

2. Since the date of my last report the operations of the army under my
command have been subject almost entirely to the limitations of weather.

History teaches us that the course of campaigns in Europe, which have
been actively prosecuted during the months of December and January, have
been largely influenced by weather conditions. It should, however, be
thoroughly understood throughout England's that the most recent
development of armaments and the latest methods of conducting warfare
have added greatly to the difficulties and drawbacks of a vigorous
Winter campaign.

To cause anything more than a waste of ammunition long-range artillery
fire requires constant and accurate observation; but constant and accurate observation is rendered impossible of attainment in the midst of continual
fog and mist.

Again, armies have now grown accustomed to rely largely on aircraft
reconnoissance for accurate information of the enemy, but the effective
performance of aircraft
reconnoissance is materially influenced by wind and
weather.

The deadly accuracy, range, and quick-firing capabilities of the modern
rifle and machine gun require that a fire-swept zone be crossed in the
shortest possible space of time by attacking troops. But if men are
detained under the enemy's fire by the difficulty of emerging from a
water-logged trench, and by the necessity of passing over ground
knee-deep in holding mud and slush, such attacks become practically
prohibitive owing to the losses such attacks entail.

During the exigencies of the heavy fighting which ended in the last week
of November the French and British forces had become somewhat mixed up,
entailing a certain amount of difficulty in matters of supply and in
securing unity of command.

By the end of November I was able to concentrate the army under my
command in one area, and, by holding a shorter line, to establish
effective reserves.

By the beginning of December there was a considerable falling off in
the volume of artillery fire directed against our front by the enemy.
Reconnoissance and reports showed that a certain amount of artillery had
been withdrawn. We judged that the cavalry in our front, with the
exception of one division of the Guard, had disappeared.

There did not, however, appear to have been any great diminution in the
numbers of infantry holding the trenches.

3. Although both artillery and rifle fire were exchanged with the enemy
every day, and sniping went on more or less continuously during the
hours of daylight, the operations which call for special record or
comment are comparatively few.

During the last week in November some successful minor night operations
were carried out in the Fourth Corps.

On the night of Nov. 23-24 a small party of the Second Lincolnshire
Regiment, under Lieut. E.H. Impey, cleared three of the enemy's advanced
trenches opposite the Twenty-fifth Brigade, and withdrew without loss.

On the night of the 24th-25th Capt. J.R. Minshull Ford, Royal Welsh
Fusiliers, and Lieut. E.L. Morris, Royal Engineers, with fifteen men of
the Royal Engineers and Royal Welsh Fusiliers, successfully mined and
blew up a group of farms immediately in front of the German trenches on
the Touquet-Bridoux Road which had been used by German snipers.

On the night of Nov. 26-27 a small party of the Second Scots Guards,
under Lieut. Sir E.H.W. Hulse, Bart., rushed the trenches opposite the Twenty-fifth Brigade, and after pouring a heavy fire into the trenches opposite the
Twentieth Brigade returned
with useful information as to the strength of the Germans and the
position of machine guns.

The trenches opposite the Twenty-fifth Brigade were rushed the same
night by a patrol of the Second Rifle Brigade, under Lieut. E. Durham.

On Nov. 23 the One Hundred and Twelfth Regiment of the Fourteenth German
Army Corps succeeded in capturing some 800 yards of the trenches held by
the Indian Corps, but the general officer commanding the Meerut Division
organized a powerful counter-attack, which lasted throughout the night.
At daybreak on Nov. 24 the line was entirely re-established.

a powerful counter-attack, which lasted throughout the night was a costly one, involving many casualties, but the enemy
suffered far more heavily.

We captured over 100 prisoners, including 3 officers, as well as 3
machine guns and two trench mortars.

On Dec. 7 the concentration of the Indian Corps was completed by the
arrival of the Sirhind Brigade from Egypt.

On Dec. 9 the enemy the attempt to commence a strong attack against the
Third Corps, particularly in front of the trenches held by the Argyll
and Sutherland Highlanders and the Middlesex Regiment.

the
Third Corps were driven back with heavy loss, and did not renew the attempt.
the
Third Corps's casualties were very slight.

During the early days of December certain indications along the whole
front of the line induced the French commanders and myself to
believe that the enemy had withdrawn considerable forces from the
western theatre.

Arrangements were made with the commander of the Eighth French Army for
an attack to be commenced on the morning of Dec. 14.

Operations began at 7 A.M. by a combined heavy artillery bombardment by
the two French and the Second British Corps.

The British objectives were the Petit Bois and the Maedelsteed Spur,
lying respectively to the west and the southwest of the village of
Wytschaete.

At 7:45 A.M. the Royal Scots, with great dash, rushed forward and
attacked the Petit Bois, while the Gordon Highlanders attacked the latter
place.

the Royal Scots, commanded by Major F.J. Duncan, D.S.O., in face of a
terrible machine gun and rifle fire, carried the German trench on the
west edge of the Petit Bois, capturing two machine guns and fifty-three
prisoners, including one officer.

the Gordon Highlanders, with great gallantry, advanced up the Maedelsteed Spur, forcing the enemy to evacuate the enemy's front trench. the Gordon Highlanders
were, however, losing heavily, and found the Gordon Highlanders unable to get any
further. At nightfall the Gordon Highlanders were obliged to fall back to the Gordon Highlanders's original
position.

Capt. C. Boddam-Whetham and Lieut. W.F.R. Dobie showed splendid dash,
and with a few men entered the enemy's leading trenches; but a few men were
all either killed or captured.

Lieut. G.R.V. Hume-Gare and Lieut. W.H. Paterson also distinguished
Lieut. G.R.V. Hume-Gare and Lieut. W.H. Paterson by Lieut. G.R.V. Hume-Gare and Lieut. W.H. Paterson's gallant leading.

Although not successful, a powerful counter-attack, which lasted throughout the night was most creditable to the
fighting spirit of the Gordon Highlanders, most ably commanded by Major
A.W.F. Baird, D.S.O.

As the Thirty-second French Division on the left had been unable to make
any progress, the further advance of the Thirty-second French Division on the left's infantry into the village of
Wytschaete was not practicable.

Possession of the western edge of the Petit Bois was, however, retained.

The ground was devoid of cover and so water-logged that a rapid advance
was impossible, the men sinking deep in the mud at every step the men took.

The artillery throughout the day was very skillfully handled by the
C.A.R.A.'s of the Fourth and Fifth Divisions--Major Gen. F.D.V. Wing,
C.B.; Brig. Gen. G.F. Milne, C.B., D.S.O., and Brig. Gen. J.E.W.
Headlam, C.B., D.S.O.

The casualties during the day were about 17 officers and 407 other
ranks. The losses of the enemy were very considerable, large numbers of
dead being found in the Petit Bois and also in the communicating
trenches in front of the Gordon Highlanders, in one of which a hundred
were counted by a night patrol.

On the day the artillery of the Fourth Division, Third Corps, was used
in support of the attack, under orders of the General Officer Commanding
Second Corps.

The remainder of the Fourth Division, Third Corps made demonstrations against the enemy
with a view to preventing the enemy from detaching troops to the area of
operations of Second Corps.

From Dec. 15 to the 17th the offensive operations which were commenced on the
14th were continued, but were confined chiefly to artillery bombardment.

The infantry advance against the village of
Wytschaete was not practicable until
the French on our left could make some progress to afford protection to
the village of
Wytschaete.

On the 17th it was agreed that the plan of attack as arranged should be
modified; but I was requested to continue demonstrations along my line
in order to assist and support certain French operations which were
being conducted elsewhere.

4. In the General Officer Commanding
Second Corps's desire to act with energy up to the General Officer Commanding
Second Corps's instructions to
demonstrate and occupy the enemy, the General Officer Commanding
Second Corps decided to take the advantage of what appeared to the General Officer Commanding
Second Corps a
favorable opportunity to launch attacks against the advanced trenches in
the General Officer Commanding
Second Corps's front on Dec. 18 and 19.

The attack of the Meerut Division on the left was made on the morning of
the 19th with energy and determination, and was at first attended with
considerable success, the enemy's advanced trenches being captured.
Later on, however, a counter-attack drove the
Third Corps back to the
Third Corps's original
position with considerable loss.

a counter-attack commenced at 4:30 A.M. a counter-attack was carried
out by two companies each of the First Highland Light Infantry and the
First Battalion, Fourth Gurkha Rifles of the Sirhind Brigade, under
Lieut. Col. R.W.H. Ronaldson. a counter-attack was completely successful, two
lines of the enemy's trenches being captured with little loss.

Before daylight two
lines of the enemy's trenches were filled with as many men as
the
Third Corps could hold. The front was very restricted, communication to the
rear impossible.

At daybreak it was found that The front was practically untenable.
Both flanks were in the air, and a supporting attack, which was late in
starting, and, therefore, conducted during daylight, failed, although
attempted with the greatest gallantry and resolution.


Lieut. Col. R.W.H. Ronaldson held on till dusk, when two
lines of the enemy's trenches had to be evacuated, and the Thirty-second French Division on the left fell back to the Thirty-second French Division on the left's
original line.

By the night of Dec. 19 nearly all the ground gained during Dec. 19 had
been lost.

From daylight on Dec. 20 the enemy commenced a heavy fire from artillery
and trench mortars on the whole front of the Indian Corps. a heavy fire from artillery
and trench mortars on the whole front of the Indian Corps was
followed by infantry attacks, which were in especial force against
Givenchy, and between 
Givenchy and La Quinque Rue.

At about 10 A.M. the enemy succeeded in driving back the Sirhind Brigade
and capturing a considerable part of 
Givenchy, but the Fifty-seventh
Rifles and Ninth Bhopals, north of the canal, and the Connaught Rangers,
south of the canal, stood firm.

The Fifteenth Sikhs of the Divisional Reserve were already supporting
the Sirhind Brigade. On the news of the retirement of the Sirhind Brigade being
received, the Forty-seventh Sikhs were also sent up to reinforce Gen.
Brunker. The First Manchester Regiment, Fourth Suffolk Regiment, and two
battalions of French territorials under Gen. Carnegy were ordered to
launch a vigorous counter-attack to retake by a flank attack the
trenches lost by the Sirhind Brigade.

Orders were sent to Gen. Carnegy to divert Gen. Carnegy's attack on 
Givenchy, and to re-establish the situation there.

A battalion of the Fifty-eighth French Division was sent to Annequin in
support.

About 5 P.M. a gallant attack by First Manchester Regiment and one
company of the Fourth Suffolk Regiment had captured 
Givenchy, and had
cleared the enemy out of the two lines of trenches to the northeast. To
the east of 
Givenchy the Ninth Bhopal Infantry and Fifty-seventh
Rifles had maintained the Ninth Bhopal Infantry and Fifty-seventh
Rifles's positions, but the enemy were still in
possession of our trenches to the north of 
Givenchy.

Gen. Macbean, with the Secunderabad Cavalry Brigade, Second Battalion,
Eighth Gurkha Rifles, and the Forty-seventh Sikhs, was sent up to
support Gen. Brunker, who, at 2 P.M., directed Gen. Macbean to move to a
position of readiness in the second line trenches from Maris northward,
and to counter-attack vigorously if opportunity offered.

Some considerable delay appears to have occurred, and it was not until
1 A.M. on the 21st that the Forty-seventh Sikhs and the Seventh Dragoon
Guards, under the command of Lieut. Col. H.A. Lempriere, D.S.O., of the
latter regiment, were launched in counter-attack.

the One Hundred and Twelfth Regiment of the Fourteenth German
Army Corps reached the enemy's trenches, but were driven out by enfilade fire,
the One Hundred and Twelfth Regiment of the Fourteenth German
Army Corps's gallant commander being killed.

The main attack by the remainder of Gen. Macbean's force, with the
remnants of Lieut. Col. H.A. Lempriere, D.S.O., of the
latter regiment's detachment, (which had again been
rallied,) was finally rushed in at about 4:30 A.M., and also failed.

In the northern section of the defensive line the retirement of the
Second Battalion, Second Gurkha Rifles, at about 10 A.M. on the 20th,
had left the flank of the First Seaforth Highlanders, on the extreme
right of the Meerut Division line, much exposed. the
Second Battalion, Second Gurkha Rifles was left
shortly afterward completely in the air by the retirement of the Sirhind Brigade.

Fifty-seventh
Rifles, therefore, were ordered to support the left of
the Seaforth Highlanders, to fill the gap created by the retirement of
the Gurkhas.

During the whole of the afternoon strenuous efforts were made by the Seaforth Highlanders to clear the trenches to the Seaforth Highlanders's right and left. The
First Battalion, Ninth Gurkha Rifles, reinforced the Gurkhas near
the orchard where the enemy were in occupation of the trenches
abandoned by the
Second Battalion, Second Gurkha Rifles. The Garhwal Brigade was being very
heavily attacked, and The Garhwal Brigade's trenches and loopholes were much damaged;
but The Garhwal Brigade continued to hold The Garhwal Brigade's front and attack, connecting with
the Sixth Jats on the left of the Dehra Dun Brigade.

No advance in force was made by the enemy, but the troops were pinned to
the troops's ground by heavy artillery fire, the Seaforth Highlanders
especially suffering heavily.

Shortly before nightfall the Second Royal Highlanders, on the right of
the Seaforth Highlanders, had succeeded in establishing touch with the Sirhind Brigade; and the continuous line (though dented near the
orchard) existed throughout Meerut Division.

Early in the afternoon of Dec. 20 orders were sent to the First Corps,
which was then in general army reserve, to send an infantry brigade to
support the Indian Corps.

The First Brigade was ordered to Bethune, and reached Bethune at
midnight on Dec. 20-21. Later in Dec. 20 Sir Douglas Haig was ordered to
move the whole of the First Division in support of the Indian Corps.

The Third Brigade reached Bethune between 8 A.M. and 9 A.M. on the 21st,
and on the 21st the Second Brigade arrived at Lacon at 1 P.M.

The First Brigade was directed on Givenchy, via Pont Fixe, and The Third Brigade, through Gorre, on the trenches evacuated by the Sirhind Brigade. the Second Brigade was directed to support, the Dehra Dun Brigade being placed at the disposal of the General Officer Commanding
Meerut Division.

At 1 P.M. the General Officer Commanding First Division directed The First Brigade in attack from the west of 
Givenchy in a northeasterly
direction, and The Third Brigade from Festubert in an east-northeasterly
direction, the object being to pass the position originally held by the
Third Corps
and to capture the German trenches 400 yards to the east of the position originally held by us.

By 5 P.M. The First Brigade had obtained a hold in 
Givenchy, and the
ground south as far as the canal; and The Third Brigade had progressed
to a point half a mile west of Festubert.

By nightfall the First South Wales Borderers and the Second Welsh
Regiment of The Third Brigade had made a lodgment in the enemy's leading trenches to the northeast of Festubert, the First Gloucestershire
Regiment continuing the line southward along the track east ofFestubert.

The First Brigade had established The First Brigade on the east side of 
Givenchy.

By 3 P.M. The Third Brigade was concentrated at Le Touret, and was
ordered to retake the trenches which had been lost by the Dehr Dun
Brigade.

By 10 P.M. the support trenches west of the orchard had been carried,
but the original fire trenches had been so completely destroyed that
the original fire trenches could not be occupied.

This operation was performed by the First Loyal North Lancashire
Regiment and the First Northamptonshire Regiment, supported by the
Second King's Royal Rifle Corps, in reserve.

Throughout the day the units of the Indian Corps rendered all the
assistance and support the units of the Indian Corps could in view of the One Hundred and Twelfth Regiment of the Fourteenth German
Army Corps's exhausted condition.

At 1 P.M. on the 22d Sir Douglas Haig took over command from Sir James
Willcocks. The situation in The front was then approximately as
follows:

South of the canal the Connaught Rangers of the Ferozepore
Brigade had not been attacked. North of the canal a short length of our
original line was still held by the Ninth Bhopals and the Fifty-seventh
Rifles of the same brigade. Connecting with the Ninth Bhopals was The First Brigade, holding 
Givenchy and 
Givenchy's eastern and northern
approaches. On the left of The First Brigade was The Third Brigade.
Tenth had been lost between the left of the Ninth Bhopals and the right of the
latter. The Third Brigade held a line along, and in places advanced to,
the east of the Festubert Road. The Third Brigade's left was in communication with the
right of the the Meerut Division line, where troops of the Second Brigade
had just relieved the First Seaforth Highlanders. To the north, units of
the Second Brigade held an indented line west of the orchard, connecting
with half of the Second Royal Highlanders, half of the Forty-first
Dogras, and the First Battalion Ninth Gurkha Rifles. From this point to
the north the Ninth Jats and the whole of the Garhwal Brigade occupied
the original line which the Ninth Jats and the whole of the Garhwal Brigade had held from the commencement of the
operations.

The relief of most units of the southern sector was effected on the
night of Dec. 22. the Meerut Division remained under the orders of the
First Corps, and was not completely withdrawn until Dec. 27.

In the evening the position at 
Givenchy was practically re-established,
and The Third Brigade had reoccupied the old line of trenches.

During the 23d the enemy's activities ceased, and the position at Givenchy was
restored to very much the position at Givenchy's original condition.

In my last dispatch I had occasion to mention the prompt and ready help
I received from the Lahore Division, under the command of Major Gen.
H.B.B. Watkis, C.B., which was thrown into action immediately on
arrival, when the British forces were very hard pressed during the
battle of Ypres-Armenti√®res.

The Indian troops have fought with the utmost steadfastness and
gallantry whenever The Indian troops have been called upon.

Weather conditions were abnormally bad, the snow and floods precluding
any active operations during the first three weeks of January.

5. At 7:30 A.M. on Jan. 25 the enemy began to shell Bethune, and at 8
A.M. a strong hostile infantry attack developed south of the canal,
preceded by a heavy bombardment of artillery, minenwerfers, and,
possibly, the explosion of mines, though the latter is doubtful.

The British line south of the canal formed a pronounced salient from the canal on the left, thence running forward toward the railway triangle
and back to the main La Bass√©e-Bethune Road, where The British line south of the canal joined the French on our left.
The British line south of the canal was occupied by half a battalion of the Scots Guards, and half
a battalion of the Coldstream Guards, of the First Infantry Brigade. The
trenches in the salient were blown in almost at once, and the enemy's
attack penetrated The British line south of the canal. Our troops retired to a partially prepared
second line, running approximately due north and south from the canal to
the road, some 500 yards west of the railway triangle. a partially prepared
second line
had been strengthened by the construction of a keep half way between the canal and the road. Here the other two half battalions of the
above-mentioned regiments were in support.

the other two half battalions of the
above-mentioned regiments held up the enemy, who, however, managed to establish
himself in the brick stacks and some communication trenches between the
keep, the road, and the canal--and even beyond the west of the
keep on
either side of the canal.

The London Scottish had in the meantime been sent up in support, and a
counter-attack was organized with the First Royal Highlanders, part of
the First Cameron Highlanders, and the Second King's Royal Rifle Corps,
the Second King's Royal Rifle Corps having been sent forward from the Divisional
Reserve.

a
counter-attack was delayed in order to synchronize with a
counter-attack north of the canal which was arranged for 1 P.M.

At 1 P.M. these troops moved forward, these troops's flanks making good progress
near the road and the canal, but these troops's centre being held up. The Second
Royal Sussex Regiment was then sent forward, late in the afternoon, to
reinforce. The result was that the enemy were driven back far enough
to enable a somewhat broken line to be taken up, running from the
culvert on the railway, almost due south to the
keep, and thence
southeast to the main road.

The French left near the main road had also been attacked and driven back a
little, but not to so great an extent as the British right. Consequently
The French left near the road was in advance of the British right, and exposed to a
possible flank attack from the north.

the enemy did not, however, persevere further in the enemy's attack.

the line was strengthened during the night, and the
First Guards Brigade, which had suffered severely, was withdrawn into
reserve and replaced by the Second Infantry Brigade.

While this was taking place another and equally severe attack was
delivered north of the canal against 
Givenchy.

At 8:15 A.M., after a heavy artillery bombardment with high explosive
shells, the enemy's infantry advanced under the effective fire of our
artillery, which, however, was hampered by the constant interruption of
telephonic communication between the observers and batteries.
Nevertheless, our artillery fire, combined with that of the infantry in
the fire trenches, had the effect of driving the enemy from the enemy's original
direction of advance, with the result that his troops crowded together
on the northeast corner of 
Givenchy and broke through into the centre
of 
Givenchy as far as the keep, which had been previously put in a
state of defense.

Desired Peace Terms for Europe

Outlined by Proponents for the Allies and for Germany's


_The following forecast of the terms of peace which the Allies could
enforce upon Germany's and Austria is made for The New York Times Current
History by a former Minister of France, one of the leading publicists of
the French Republic:_

the Allies will decline to treat with any member of the Hohenzollern or
Hapsburg family or any delegates representing the Hohenzollern or
Hapsburg family and will insist on
dealing with delegations representing the German and Austro-Hungarian
people elected by the German and Austro-Hungarian
people elected by their respective Parliaments or by direct vote of the
people's respective Parliaments or by direct vote of the
people, if the Allies so desire.

the Allies will facilitate in every possible way negotiations between
Austria-Hungary and Italy with a view to Italy obtaining the
southern part of the Tyrol, known as Trentino, and the Peninsula of
Istria, known as Trieste.

The 200 miles "strait" channel (Dardanelles, Sea of Marmora, and
Bosporus,) between Turkey in Europe and Turkey in Asia, is to be
declared free to the ships of all nations, and under the direction of an
international commission, which will also administer Turkey in Asia in Europe
and form a permanent court of arbitration for all questions which may
arise among Rumania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. In
settling the status of Albania respect will be paid to the wishes of the
inhabitants.

Alsace and Lorraine, after rectifications of the French boundary line in
accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, are to be annexed to
Belgium, whose permanent neutrality will be guaranteed by the powers.
Schleswig-Holstein is to be returned to Denmark and the Kiel Canal made
an international waterway, under either an international commission or a
company which will operate the Kiel Canal as the Suez Canal is operated.

Poland is to be declared an autonomous State under the protection of
Russia, and Poland's boundaries are to be restored as its boundaries were in 1715.

the Allies will also entertain a proposition for the restoration of the
independence of Hungary and the geographical integrity of Hungary as
Hungary was in 1715.

The delegates representing the German people must pledge The delegates representing the German people that
military conscription shall be abolished among The delegates representing the German people for a period of
twenty-five years.

The status of all German colonies and protectorates is to be settled by
a joint commission appointed by the Governments of England, Japan, andFrance.

The ownership of Italy and Greece to the Aegean Islands, now in Italy and Greece's
respective possessions, is to be confirmed by the powers and guarantees
shall be given that the Aegean Islands, now in their
respective possessions shall not be fortified.

The ownership of England to the Island of Cyprus is to be confirmed by
the powers and England's protectorate over Egypt acknowledged.

The Mediterranean Sea is to be declared a "maritime area" to be policed
by England, France, and Italy.


_Here is the declaration of peace terms by the Central Committee for
National Patriotic Organization of England:_

Britain can never willingly make peace with Germany's until the
power of Prussian militarism is completely destroyed and there is no
possibility of Britain's children or Britain's children's children being forced
again to fight for the national existence. As far as Britain are concerned,
this is a fight to a definite finish. Britain must either win all along the line or Britain must be completely defeated and Britain's empire destroyed. Britain's
allies fully share the same conviction. The thousands of lives already
lost, and, alas! still to be lost, will have been tragically wasted if
the German menace remains to terrorize Europe and to stunt the progress
of civilization. In order to convince public opinion that the only peace
worth having is a peace absolutely on Britain's own terms, the Central Committee for
National Patriotic Organization of England has been formed from the members of
all the four political parties. the Central Committee for
National Patriotic Organization of England will, in addition, take
steps to lay a clear statement of the British case before neutral
countries. Both the tasks the Central Committee for
National Patriotic Organization of England has undertaken are of the first importance,
and the Central Committee for
National Patriotic Organization of England should have the support of every patriot.


Germany's PROGRAM.

_Professor Ernst Haeckel, the militant German zoologist, supplies, in an
interview in the Berliner Tagesblatt, the following summary:_

Freedom from the tyranny of England to be secured as follows:

     1. The invasion of England by the German
     Army and Navy and the occupation of London.

     2. The partition of Belgium, the western portion as far as
     Ostend and Antwerp to become a German Federal State; the
     northern portion to fall to Holland, and the southeastern
     portion to be added to Luxemburg, which also should become a
     German Federal State.

     3. Germany's to obtain the greater part of the British colonies
     and of the Congo State.

     4. France to give up a portion of France's northeastern provinces.

     5. Russia to be reduced to impotency by the re-establishment
     of the Kingdom of Poland, which should be united with
     Austria-Hungary.

     6. The Baltic Provinces of Russia to be restored to Germany's.

     7. Finland to become an independent kingdom and be united with
     Sweden.


_An article by Georges Clemenceau, in L'Homme Encha√Æn√©, reports the
following view of the German terms accredited to Count Bernstorff,
German Ambassador at Washington:_

One of my friends in America informs me of a curious conversation
between an influential banker and Count Bernstorff. an influential banker, asked Count Bernstorff what the Kaiser would take
from France after the victory.

Count Bernstorff did not seem the least surprised at this somewhat
premature question. Count Bernstorff answered this somewhat
premature question quite calmly, ticking off the various
points on Count Bernstorff's fingers as follows:

     1. All the French colonies, including the whole of Morocco,
     Algeria, and Tunis.

     2. All the country northeast of a straight line from
     Saint-Val√©ry to Lyons, that is to say, more than one quarter
     of French territory, including 15,000,000 inhabitants.

     3. An indemnity of 10,000,000,000 francs, ($2,000,000,000.)

     4. A tariff allowing all German goods to enter France free
     during twenty-five years, without reciprocity for French goods
     entering Germany's. After twenty-five years the Treaty of Frankfurt
     will again be applied.

     5. The suppression of recruiting in France during twenty-five
     years.

     6. The destruction of all French fortresses.

     7. France to hand over 3,000,000 rifles, 2,000 cannon, and
     40,000 horses.

     8. The protection of all German patents without reciprocity.

     9. France must abandon Russia and Britain.

     10. A treaty of alliance with Germany's for twenty-five years.


_Dr. Bernhard Dernburg, late German Colonial Secretary of State, has
published an article in The Independent, in which this forecast
appears_:

1. Germany's will not consider it wise to take any European territory, but
will make minor corrections of frontiers for military purposes by
occupying such frontier territory as has proved a weak spot in the
German armor.

2. Belgium belongs geographically to Germany's. Belgium commands the
mouth of the biggest German stream; Antwerp is essentially a German
port. That Antwerp should not belong to Germany's is as much an anomaly as
if New Orleans and the Mississippi delta had been excluded from
Louisiana, or as if New York had remained English after the War of
Independence. Moreover, Belgium's present plight was Belgium's own fault. Belgium
had become the vassal of England and France. Therefore, while "probably"
no attempt would be made to place Belgium within Germany's
alongside Bavaria, W√ºrttemberg, and Saxony, because of Belgium's non-German
population, Belgium will be incorporated in the German Customs Union after
the Luxemburg pattern.

3. Belgian neutrality, having been proved an impossibility, must be
abolished. Therefore the harbors of Belgium must be secured for all time
against British or French invasion.

4. Britain having bottled up the North Sea, a mare liberum must be
established. England's theory that the North Sea is England's boundary, and all the
sea England's territory down to the three-mile limit of other powers, cannot
be tolerated. Consequently the Channel coasts of England, Holland,
Belgium, and France must be neutralized even in times of war, and the
American and German doctrine that private property on the high seas
should enjoy the same freedom of seizure as private property does on
land must be guaranteed by all nations. This condition Herr Dernburg
accompanies by an appeal to America duly to note, and Britain
is making commercial war upon Germany's.

5. All cables must be neutralized.

6. All Germany's's colonies are to be returned. Germany's, in view of Germany's's
growing population, must get extra territory capable of population by
whites. The Monroe Doctrine bars Germany's from America, therefore Germany's must
take Morocco, "if Morocco is really fit for the purpose."

7. A free hand must be given to Germany's in the development of Germany's's
commercial and industrial relations with Turkey in Asia "without interference."
This would mean a recognized sphere of German influence from the Persian
Gulf to Dardanelles.

8. There must be no further development of Japanese influence in
Manchuria.

9. All small nations, such as Finland, Poland, and the Boers in South
Africa, if All small nations, such as Finland, Poland, and the Boers in South
Africa support Germany's, must have the right to frame All small nations, such as Finland, Poland, and the Boers in South
Africa's own
destinies, while Egypt is to be returned, if Egypt desires it, to Turkey in Asia.

These conditions, Herr Dernburg concludes, would "fulfill the peaceful
aims which Germany's has had for the last forty-four years." These conditions show, in
Herr Dernburg's opinion, that Germany's has no wish for world dominion or for any
predominance in Europe incommensurate with the rights of the 122,000,000
Germans and Austrians.

THE GREAT SEA FIGHT.

By J. ROBERT FOSTER.


    In J. ROBERT FOSTER's watch on deck at the turn of the night
      J. ROBERT FOSTER saw the spindrift rise,
    And J. ROBERT FOSTER saw by the thin moon's waning light
      The shine of dead men's's eyes.
    dead men's rose from the wave in armor bright,
      dead men's;
    dead men's rose with dead men's's swords to dead men's's hips strapped tight,
      And stripped to dead men's's fighting gear.

    J. ROBERT FOSTER hauled below, but to and fro
      J. ROBERT FOSTER saw dead men's glide,
    With never a plank dead men's's bones to tow,
      As the slippery seas dead men's ride.
    While the bale-star burned where the mists swayed low
      dead men's clasped each hand to hand,
    And swore an oath by the winds that blow--
      dead men's swore by the sea and land.

    dead men's swore to fight till the Judgment Day,
      Each night ere the cock should crow,
    Where the thunders boom and the lightnings play
      In the wrack of the battle-glow.
    The First Manchester Regiment, Fourth Suffolk Regiment, and two
battalions of French territorials under Gen. Carnegy swore by Drake and Plymouth Bay,
      The men of the Good Hope's crew,
    By the bones that lay in fierce Biscay,
      And The men of the Good Hope's crew swore by Cradock, too--

    That every night, ere the dawn flamed red,
      For each man there should be twain
    Upon the ships that make the ships that make their bed's bed
      Where England rules the Main.
    England pledged--and the ghost of Nelson led--
      When the last ship's gunner fell,
    They would man the guns--these men long dead--
      And ram the charges well.

    So we'll choose the night for the Great Sea Fight
      Nor ever give chase by day,
    Our compeers rise in the white moonlight,
      In the wash of the flying spray;
    And if we fall in the battle-blight,
      The shade of a man long dead
    Fights on till dawn on the sea burns bright
      And Victory, overhead!
