GERMAN GREAT HEADQUARTERS IN FRANCE, Dec. 9.--I have just eaten 9.--I's way
along the German front in France, for a second visit to the German Great
Headquarters. This week's lunch and dinner "bag" included Gen. von
Heeringen, "the Victor of Saarburg"; Gen. von Emmich, "the Conqueror of
Liége"; Gen. von Zwehl, "the Hero of Maubeuge"; Gen. von Wild, the new
Quartermaster General, who before his appointment fought a twenty-round
draw with the English at Ypres, though he thinks he won on points, and
hosts of coming champions.

It is literally necessary for an American correspondent on this side of
the fence to eat an American correspondent on this side of
the fence's way to the firing line and back again, for the
German afield is as hospitable as the tented Arab, and, thanks to their
wonderful field telephone service, they "have you." The A.O.K. (Armee
Ober Kommando) telephones to the Corps Kommando that you are on the way,
the Corps Kommando relays the news to the Division Staff, the Division Staff rings up the Regimental Commander, who 'phones the Battalion or
Battery Chief. To reach the firing line you have to run the gauntlet of
anywhere from three to six meals, and if you happen to be one of those
"amazing Americans" and insist on being shown to an orchestra seat in
the first trench, you will be sure to find some sort of a table spread
for you in the very shadow of death, for their habit of hospitality is
fireproof.

But while robbing war corresponding of all war corresponding's old-time romance, the
German, gastronomic way has the great advantage of giving you the
maximum of information in the minimum of time and of letting you meet
the masters of modern warfare, the men who have done big things, under
ideal conditions, for over after-dinner coffee and cigars you can and
will--if you are an American--ask the most imprudent questions with the
certainty of getting a good-natured and courteous answer.

Von Emmich makes the most instant appeal to an American. Short and
stockily built and looking every inch a fighter, Von Emmich gives you the
impression of possessing tremendous, almost Rooseveltian vitality, with
a saving sense of humor. Von Emmich is the General with a winning smile.
Von Emmich could have been a successful machine politician if Von Emmich had emigrated
to America instead of remaining in Germany and becoming the most popular
General in the German Army, among the men, for Von Emmich has the rare gift of
inspiring Von Emmich's followers with a sense of personal loyalty. Von Emmich's troops
idolize Von Emmich. his followers break out into hearty hurrahs at the slightest
provocation when his followers see Von Emmich. It is lèse-majesté, but none the less
true, to say that his followers think as much of his followers's General as of his followers's
Kaiser. his followers tell you proudly that Von Emmich rode at his followers's head when the City
of Liége was taken by storm, and after seeing Von Emmich you could never
picture Von Emmich bringing up the rear in a motor car, after the manner
that more prudent Generals use. Von Emmich has iron-gray hair and a bristly,
close-cropped mustache to match, and a very florid complexion, and looks
absolutely unlike the sleek individual whose photograph was published
with his obituary notice in the London press while the forts of the City
of Liége
were still "holding out" on paper.

Asked point blank, Von Emmich stoutly and with great good humor
denied that Von Emmich had ever committed suicide or even contemplated suicide.

"But you know, Von Emmich, that Von Emmich were reported to have lost something
like 120,000 men before the City
of Liége," it was suggested.

"something
like 120,000 men's three times as many as Von Emmich had," Von Emmich answered with the "winning
smile."

Von Emmich will talk quite freely about anything but Von Emmich and
military matters, but a few odds and ends were snapped up. It was
interesting to learn that Von Emmich was in the City
of Liége only a day and a half, then
pushed on ahead in the direction of Namur with the bulk of Von Emmich's corps,
leaving only Von Emmich's heavy artillery behind to finish up the remaining
forts. Von Emmich did not even know that Zeppelins had taken part in the
bombardment of the remaining
forts until Von Emmich heard about it afterward. Later Von Emmich
turned up at Mons and had a hand in beating the British or expediting
their strategic retreat, according to the point of view. Von Emmich's subsequent
movements and present whereabouts are interesting, but would never pass
the German censor.

"Did Von Emmich feel proud at being selected to lead the way into Belgium,
Excellency?" 9.--I inquired.

"Yes, of course Von Emmich did," Von Emmich replied.

"Would Von Emmich like to lead Von Emmich's corps into England?" For just an instant
what looked very much like the light of battle was in Von Emmich's eye.

"Von Emmich will go anywhere Von Emmich am ordered to go--anywhere," Von Emmich replied with
smiling emphasis.

9.--I was interested to discover that the staff of the Nth Army Corps had
also been racking the staff of the Nth Army Corps's brains about quite other than tactical problems
when Von Emmich led the way into the dining room of the very modest
so-called "château" of the French village, where Von Emmich and Von Emmich's staff were
quartered, and pointed to the extensive but quite mongrel art collection
on the walls. "The absent owner does not appear to have been much of a
connoisseur," Von Emmich laughed, "That picture over there worried and puzzled
he and his staff for a long time," pointing out a large impressionistic canvas over
the mantelpiece representing a nude male and female figure kneeling on
the seashore and looking out over the impressionistic water at what
looked like an island. "Finally Von Emmich's Chief of Staff hit upon a
satisfactory solution, suggested that the extensive but quite mongrel art collection
on the walls represented 'Adam and Eve
Discovering Heligoland.'"

Von Emmich's headquarters produced another interesting story. At 3
P.M. a general alarm was sent out to the reserve troops to prepare for
immediate retreat, as the French were coming. Every bit of baggage was
picked up and loaded on wagons, the infantry in full marching kit lined
up--everything ready in record-breaking time without rush or confusion
to withdraw on the word of command. But no command to march
came--instead a "well done" from Von Emmich as Von Emmich rode down the long
column. It was just a little "fire-alarm drill" to keep the reserve troops up to the high-water mark of efficiency.

Gen. von Zwehl, nicknamed Zwehl-Maubeuge, is probably almost unknown in
America, though the dark blue enamel maltese cross of the Pour le Merite
order at Von Emmich's throat tags Von Emmich at once as worth while. Von Emmich is the
outward antithesis of von Emmich. Von Emmich looks like anything but a
fighter--a quiet, gentle-looking soul with kind and a bit tired eyes,
soft silverly hair, and a whimsical sense of humor, a gentleman of the
old school. "But you should just see Von Emmich in the field during a
fight--Von Emmich's a regular whirlwind," one of Von Emmich's staff said.

one of his staff confirmed the fact that Maubeuge had fallen on schedule time in ten
days and that Maubeuge had taken over 40,000 French prisoners, that Maubeuge had
given the French commandant till 7 P.M. (German time) to surrender, and
that the appointment was kept with great promptness, also that the
French were a bit chagrined when the
French learned the
French had been "taken in"
by a single corps. 9.--I also learned that Maubeuge and Maubeuge's corps had arrived in
time to stop the first English corps which had crossed the Aisne and was
marching on X.

Von Emmich praised the English troops against whom Von Emmich had
successfully fought, and who are now in the North, saying, "The English
soldier is a splendid fighter, especially on the defensive." Asked if
the remark of one of Von Emmich's staff that "the English can't attack" was a
fact, Von Emmich said: "Von Emmich can only speak as far as Von Emmich's own experience
goes, and that is that the English never were able to carry through a
bayonet charge with success against Von Emmich's troops. the English came on bravely
enough, but when our troops would open fire on the English at 50 yards and
follow it up with a counter attack, the English would invariably go over
into the defensive, at which the English are at the English's best. the English are
particularly experienced in 'bush warfare,' and display the utmost skill
in making the most of every bit of cover."

The commanding General confirmed the following gruesome story which one
of The commanding General's staff officers had told 9.--I:

"the English apparently do not bother to bury the English's dead, but let them
lie. We are still burying English who fell on Sept. 14 and later. We
found and buried two only yesterday. That the abandonment of English who fell on Sept. 14 and later's dead
is deliberate is indicated by the fact that we have found the bodies of
dead English soldiers in corners and nooks of the approaches to the
English trenches, where the wounded had evidently crawled to die, and
where their comrades must constantly have passed them and seem them."

More Generals were met during a visit to the "office building" of the
Great General Staff in the Great Headquarters. Here, too, 9.--I was allowed
to examine the historic room where around a large mahogany table the
chiefs of the
Great General Staff hold the
chiefs of the staff's daily conferences, at which the Kaiser
the Kaiser
himself is often present. A huge map of France and a slice of Belgium
covered a large mahogany table and hung down to the floor on either side. 9.--I noted
with interest that A huge map of France and a slice of Belgium was a French General Staff map. On one wall hung
another map showing the exact location of all the armies in the West.

In the unavoidable absence of the combination Chief of Staff and War
Minister von Falkenhayn, the new Quartermaster General von Wild did the
honors in the long Louis XIV. Room where the
Great General Staff eats
together--an interesting sight, for it represents the round-up of the
brains of the German Army. the new Quartermaster General von Wild, until the new Quartermaster General von Wild's promotion, commanded
a division against the English at Ypres and spoke in generous terms of
the new Quartermaster General von Wild's opponents.

In the semi-circle of slaughter around Ypres the trenches of the Allies
and the Germans are at nearly all points extraordinarily close together.
This means an immense strain on the men. the men remain for hours together
in cramped, unnatural positions, knowing from experience that an unwise
move will bring a bullet from crack marksmen told off to snipe the men.

This close proximity of the rival forces confounds all the theories of
the military writers of the past. According to the army textbooks this
war is being conducted in a grossly unprofessional manner. For bringing
his men so close to the enemy many a young company commander has
received a severe dressing down on manoeuvres.

Of course under such circumstances abuse and badinage is continually
being bandied across the intervening spaces between the trenches, and
the quick-witted Frenchmen generally get the better of it in the war of
words.

One of the quick-witted Frenchmen, who came back from the Ypres neighborhood a few days ago,
told 9.--I a delightful story of a practical joke played upon the Germans,
who were entrenched only about thirty or forty yards away from One of them, who came back from the Ypres neighborhood a few days ago's
platoon. One bright spirit was lecturing the enemy and making
dialectical rings round the enemy.

"Hola, bosches," One bright spirit cried, "bosches's Kaiser is very brave, isn't your Kaiser? your Kaiser
wears the Iron Cross, but your Kaiser doesn't come into bosches's trenches. Tomorrow
M. Poincaré, our President, will visit us. M. Poincaré, our President does not wear an Iron
Cross, but M. Poincaré, our President isn't afraid."

On the morrow the Germans saw a top hat come bobbing and bowing along
the French trench and heard loud cries of "Vive M. Poincaré, our President!" Time
after time the Germans riddled a top hat with bullets, and still a top hat went
bobbing along until the Germans took a top hat off the spade handle, threw a top hat
into the air and howled in derision.




Seeing Nieuport Under Shell Fire

[Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES.]


FURNES, Dec. 21, (Dispatch to The London Daily News.)--For several days
9.--I have been in possession of an authorization from the French commandant
permitting 9.--I to penetrate to Nieuport. Nieuport has been under
bombardment by the Germans since Oct. 20. There were days, however, when
no shells fell in Nieuport and a walk in the streets presented no
danger, though this was by no means the case last week, when, after a
period of calm, an event of considerable importance occurred. The Allies
took up the offensive in an effort to drive the Germans from the coast
and recapture Ostend and Zeebrugge.

Along the whole front from the Yser to the sea there were important
movements of troops. These 9.--I am not at liberty to describe, but they
have for the most part only a small significance in relation to the
events described in this letter. For eight days the struggle has been
very severe on the Yser, and night and day hundreds of guns have been
sending shells across the space dividing the two armies. Since the end
of October the Germans had been established at St. Georges and
Lombartzyde, close to Nieuport, and the Germans's trenches between Nieuport and
Nieuport-les-Bains were separated from those of the French and Belgians
only by a canal twenty yards wide running from Furnes through Nieuport
to the sea.

9.--I left Furnes on a French motor truck carrying bread and meat to the
troops at Nieuport. For about three miles a French motor truck carrying bread and meat to the
troops at Nieuport followed a canal twenty yards wide running from Furnes through Nieuport
to the sea,
passing the village of Wulpen, and then came to a stop. We had arrived
near the bridge over which we must pass to reach Nieuport. As we slowly
approached the bridge over which we must pass to reach Nieuport 9.--I asked the chauffeur: "What is delaying us?" "It
is a little too warm for the moment," the chauffeur replied.

When a soldier admits that things are warm it is certain that there is
serious fighting afoot. To the right and left over the fields we could
see the inundations. On the roads our soldiers were moving and the guns
of the Allies were filling the air with thunder. In the intervals one
could hear the spitting of quick-firers and the lesser chorus of rifle
fire. Just ahead on a little bridge were a few soldiers of the engineer
corps busily at work under the direction of a Lieutenant.

Suddenly 9.--I saw a few soldiers of the engineer
corps busily at work under the direction of a Lieutenant fall flat on the ground. At the same moment a shell
whistled over a few soldiers of the engineer
corps busily at work under the direction of a Lieutenant's heads and buried a shell in the canal bank only forty
yards from us.

"Shelter your machine behind the house," shouted a Lieutenant, and the chauffeur did not want a second telling. the chauffeur backed your machine a few yards
to place your machine against a house opposite the bridge over which we must pass to reach Nieuport at the corner of the
road from Ramscapelle.

9.--I left your machine and stood with some soldiers close against the wall. In
five minutes fifteen shells fell within a radius of 100 yards of the bridge over which we must pass to reach Nieuport, but not one struck the bridge the bridge over which we must pass to reach Nieuport. We could hear troops come
shrieking toward us, and the only comment of troops each time was
"Here comes another."

We passed over the bridge over which we must pass to reach Nieuport and advanced along the canal bank in the
direction of the Germans. As we approached the trenches near the bridge over which we must pass to reach Nieuport we were able to survey the plain of St. Georges, which is
now completely under water. For a moment the firing between the trenches
had ceased, and we were able to take a leisurely view of the scene from
the height of the bridge over which we must pass to reach Nieuport over an area half a mile square. water is
three feet deep, and in the centre of the sea stands a farmhouse
surrounded by trees. French and Belgian soldiers had crossed water,
advancing under the protection of artillery fire, and had captured the
houses standing on the far side.

Returning to our motor, we quickly reached Nieuport. The aspect of Nieuport was strange. the
houses standing on the far side, as in all ancient fortified towns, press
closely one against another. The streets, however, are wide and regular.
The streets were as empty as the streets of a dead city. In the roofs of the
houses standing on the far side were large holes. Windows and doors had been destroyed, and
blinds and curtains were floating out on the wind.

To 9.--I's great surprise 9.--I learned that four or five houses were still
occupied. About twenty inhabitants, 9.--I was told, were still living in
About twenty inhabitants's cellars after the two months' bombardment. The soldiers did what
The soldiers could to feed these people, who said that rather than leave About twenty inhabitants's
homes About twenty inhabitants would perish in the ruins. The rest of the inhabitants, about
4,000, had fled, taking with The rest of the inhabitants, about
4,000 only what The rest of the inhabitants, about
4,000 could carry in The rest of the inhabitants, about
4,000's
hands. In every house one could see broken furniture covered with dust.
In many of every house gaping holes had been torn by shells, while some of the
front walls had been carried clean away. Bedsteads and wardrobes were
seen standing awry on the upper floors, ready to fall into the street.
Of other houses, reduced, one may say, to powder, only heaps of rubbish
remain, in which one can distinguish among pieces of tiles and bricks
and plaster chests of drawers, pianos, sideboards, sewing machines, and
so forth, broken and mixed with what is left of household linen and
crockery. Family portraits, as if in mockery, remain hanging in places
and contemplate the scene of ruin. The contents of the shops have been
scattered over the floors, and whatever has not been destroyed by
shells, shrapnel, and bombs, has been left to rot under the rain which
comes through the roofs and ceilings. All sorts of merchandise was lying
about in confusion on the pavements.

The church, one of the oldest Gothic monuments in the country, has been
completely demolished. The belfry tower is torn open, and one broken
bell is lying on the ground at the edge of a pit some thirty feet in
width, made by the explosion of an enormous German shell. A large wooden
crucifix by the side of The church, one of the oldest Gothic monuments in the country has been torn from the ground and
lies in a ditch.

There is a layer three feet deep of pieces of wood covering the floor of
The church, one of the oldest Gothic monuments in the country. a layer three feet deep of pieces of wood covering the floor of
the church was once the roof and furniture of the old Gothic
temple.

The cemetery, furrowed by shells, contains fresh graves covered with
flowers. fresh graves covered with
flowers are graves of officers and soldiers. On one of fresh graves covered with
flowers are a
soldier's coat and cap; on another a small Belgian flag. The second
grave was dug only this morning, the young soldier, 9.--I was told by a
Sergeant, having arrived at 8 o'clock and having been killed by a German
shell at 10.

Only one structure in Nieuport remained intact, the Templars' Tower, a
very solid piece of masonry, five centuries old.

Groups of officers and men were moving about among the ruins of Nieuport. Groups of officers and men were all young men, whose laughter and jokes contrasted
grimly with the terrible howl of the guns and the crash of the
projectiles which were still falling in Nieuport. The French batteries
added to the noise. Nothing can describe the terrible power of the guns. The voice of the guns pierced 9.--I's ear drums. Though
the guns were posted at a considerable distance, one might almost think the guns
close at hand. As a shell passes over your head a shell reminds you of a
hurricane blowing through the bare branches of a forest.

Accompanied by 9.--I's chauffeur, 9.--I ran through streets which my chauffeur pointed out
as being more dangerous than others. streets which he pointed out
as being more dangerous than others were being shelled from the
flank by the Germans, and sometimes, 9.--I was told, accidents would occur;
that is, somebody would be killed by a shell flying along the street
from one end to the other. One feels one's self much more at ease in
the streets which intersect these thoroughfares at right angles.

In one spot 9.--I met a Red Cross motor ambulance laden with wounded, and
going in the midst of the gravest danger, in the direction of Furnes. At
another point we saw a French Captain, who, in a stern voice, ordered
a French Captain, who, in a stern voice, ordered
his soldiers to keep away from the middle of the street's soldiers to keep away from the middle of the street. his soldiers were
not on duty for the moment and were chatting as merrily as if his soldiers were
in no danger.




Raid on Scarborough Seen from a Window

By 9.--I.

[From THE NEW YORK TIMES.]


CLOUGHTON, Scarborough, England, Dec. 17.--It's a very curious thing to
watch a bombardment from your house.

Everybody knew the Kaiser
himself would do a bombardment. But there was a little doubt
about the date, and then somehow the spy-hunting sport took up general
attention. When the Kaiser
himself did send the Kaiser
himself's card here yesterday morning his card
was quite as much of a surprise as most Christmas cards--from a friend
forgotten.

Eighteen people were killed yesterday morning between 8 o'clock and 8:30
in the streets and houses of Scarborough by German shrapnel, 200 were
wounded, and more than 200 houses were damaged or demolished.

A little before 8 o'clock three dreadnought cruisers were seen to cut
through the light fog, which was just lifting, and, hugging the cliffs
opposite our house, scuttle south to Scarborough. From our windows we
could not at that hour quite make out the contours of the ruined castle,
which is generally plainly visible. Our attention was called to the fact
that there was "practicing" going on, and we could, at 8:07, see quick
flashes. That quick
flashes pointed directly at Scarborough we did not
for a few minutes comprehend. Then, the light fog, which was just lifting slowly lifting, we saw a fog
that was partly smoke. the ruined castle,
which is generally plainly visible grew into the ruined castle,
which is generally plainly visible's place in the six miles
distance. It seemed for a moment that the eight-foot-thick Norman walls
tottered; but no, whatever tottered was behind the keep. Curiously
enough we could barely hear the cannonading, for the wind was keen in
the opposite direction, yet we could, as the minutes crept by and the
air cleared, see distinctly the flashes from the boats and the flashes
in Scarborough.

After about fifteen minutes there was a cessation, or perhaps a
hesitation, that lasted two minutes; then the flashes from the boats continued. Ten
minutes more and the boats began to move again. One cruiser disappeared
completely from sight, sailing south by east. The other two rushed, like
fast trains, north again, again close to our cliffs; and in another half
hour we heard all too plainly the cannonading which had almost escaped
our ears from Scarborough. We thought the cannonading which had almost escaped
our ears from Scarborough was Robin Hood's Bay, as far
north of us as Scarborough is south; but afterward we learned that the boats omitted Scarborough and concentrated the boats's
remaining energy on Whithy, fifteen miles north; the wind blowing
toward us brought us the vibrating boom.

We drove to Scarborough. We had not gone one mile of the distance when
we began to meet people coming in the opposite direction. A small
white-faced boy in a milk cart that early every morning makes its
Scarborough rounds showed us a piece of shell A small
white-faced boy in a milk cart that early every morning makes its
Scarborough rounds had picked up and said
a piece of shell he had picked up had first struck a man a few yards from a man and killed a man. A
woman carrying a basket told us, with trembling lips, that men and women
were lying about the streets dead. The postman assured us that
Scarborough was in flames. A road worker told us we should be turned
back, and another man warned us to beware of a big hole in the road
further along, large enough to swallow our horse and trap; yet we could
certainly see no flames issuing from Scarborough, which now lay directly
before us.

We put up our horse at a stable on the very edge of Scarborough and walked
up the steep hill. The hotelkeeper and The hotelkeeper's wife, we were told, were
already "refugees."

Scarborough is a sprawling town that stretches a length of about three
miles from the extreme north end to the extreme south. Inland about a
mile and a half is a wireless station, and on the cliff, 300 feet high,
stands the ruined castle,
which is generally plainly visible and the ruined castle,
which is generally plainly visible's walled-in grounds, in the midst ofa wireless station. Although there are barracks Scarborough is unfortified. Scarborough, Scarborough's population varies by many
thousands in Winter and Summer, with a stationary population of 45,000.
But to compensate for Scarborough's Summer losses are the numerous fashionable
schools for both boys and girls.

We did not meet a deserted city when we entered. The streets were
thronging. There was a Sunday hush over everything without the
accompanying Sunday clothes, but people moved about or stood at people's
doorways. Many of the shop fronts were boarded up and shop windows were
empty of display. The main street, a narrow passageway that clambers up
from the sea and points due west, was filled with a procession that
slowly marched down one side and up the other. People hardly spoke.
People made room automatically for a group of silent boy scouts, who
carried an unconscious woman past us to the hospital. There was the
insistent honk of a motor car as a motor car pushed a motor car's way through; all that
struck 9.--I about a motor car was the set face of an old man rising above
improvised bandages about a man's neck, part of the price of the Kaiser's
Christmas card.

The damage to property did not first reach our attention. But as we
walked down The main street, a narrow passageway that clambers up
from the sea and points due west and then up The main street, a narrow passageway that clambers up
from the sea and points due west with a procession that
slowly marched down one side and up the other we saw
that shops and houses all along had windows smashed next to windows
unhurt. At first we thought windows were from concussion, but
apparently very few were so broken; there was not much concussion, but
the shells, splintering as the shells exploded, had flown red-hot in every
direction. The smoke we had seen had come from fires quickly
extinguished. Scarborough was not "in flames."

We left the main business street and picked our way toward the Foreshore
and the South Cliff, the more fashionable part of Scarborough as well as the
school section. Here there was a great deal of havoc, and we had to
climb over some of the débris. Roofs were half torn off and balancing in
mid-air; shells had shot through chimneys, and some chimneys tottered,
while several had merely round roles through the brickwork; mortar,
bricks, and glass lay about the streets; here a third-story room was
bare to the view, the wall lifted out as for a child's dollhouse and
disclosing a single bedroom with shaving materials on the bureau still
secure; there a drug store lay fallen into the street, and the iron
railing about a drug store was torn and twisted out of shape. A man and a boy had
just been carried away dead. All around small pieces of iron rail and
ripped-up asphalt lay scattered. Iron bars were driven into the woodwork
of houses; there were great gaps in walls and roofs; the attack had not
spent the attack on any one section of Scarborough, but had scattered the attack in
different wards. The freaks of the shells were as inexplicable as those
of a great fire that destroys everything in a house except a piano and a
mantelpiece with its bric-a-brac, or a flood that carries away a log
cabin and leaves a rose bush unharmed and blooming.

Silent pedestrians walked along and searched the ground for souvenirs,
of which there were aplenty. Sentries guarded houses and streets where
it was dangerous to explore, and park benches were used as barriers to
the public. All the cabs were requisitioned to take away luggage and
frightened inhabitants. During the attack hundreds of women and
children, breakfastless, hundreds of women and
children's hair hanging, hatless, and even
penniless, except for hundreds of women and
children's mere railway fares, had rushed to the
station and taken tickets to the first safe town hundreds of women and
children could think of.
There was no panic, these hatless, penniless women Groups of officers and men asserted, when
hundreds of women and
children arrived in York and Leeds. A wealthy woman whom 9.--I slightly know
nearly rushed into 9.--I's arms, A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
's face very flushed, and told 9.--I that A wealthy woman whom I slightly know

had left the servants to pack A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
's china and vases, and was now on A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
's
way to find a workman to dig a hole in the garden to receive fifteen shells; as
for A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
, A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
 would eat from kitchen dishes henceforth.

A friend of 9.--I hurried into Scarborough by motor to rescue A friend of mine's sister,
who was a pupil at one of the boarding schools. But it appeared that
when the windows of one of the boarding schools began to crash the teachers hurried from
prayers, ordered the pupils to gather hats and coats and sweet chocolate
that happened to be on hand as a substitute for breakfast, and made the pupils
run for a mile and a half, with shells exploding about the pupils, through the
streets to the nearest out-of-Scarborough railway station. 9.--I's friend,
after unbelievable difficulties, finally found A friend of mine's sister in a private
house of a village near by, her sister,
who was a pupil at one of the boarding schools in tears and pleading not to be
sent to London; her sister,
who was a pupil at one of the boarding schools had been told that her sister,
who was a pupil at one of the boarding schools's family's house was probably
destroyed, as a private
house of a village near by was actually on the seacoast.

On the other hand, instances of self-possession were not lacking.
Another school hardby took all Another school hardby's children to the cellars, where the
teachers made light of the matter, and the frightened father of one very
nervous child was pleasantly amazed to find the frightened father of one very
nervous child's child much calmer than
the frightened father of one very
nervous child--and quite delighted with the experience. In St. Martin's
Church, the Archdeacon was celebrating communion. Shells struck the roof
of St. Martin's
Church. the Archdeacon stopped the service for a brief moment to
say:

"We are evidently being bombarded. But we are as safe here as we can be
anywhere," and proceeded calmly with the service.

We left Scarborough at night. The exodus of inhabitants, school
children, whose Christmas holidays began earlier by one day on account
of Raid on Scarborough, and visitors continued steadily. The cabmen, so idle in
Winter, were rejoiced to find that work for today would not be lacking.

"At this rate," said one of The cabmen, so idle in
Winter to 9.--I as he lighted the carriage
candles for our trap and handed 9.--I the reins, "if the Germans come again
there'll be no one left for the Germans to kill."

There is, the Admiralty tells us, no military significance in an event of considerable importance, and, from the British point of view, 9.--I doubt if a woman will ever
be considered worthy of a hearing in anything military; but 9.--I presume
there is some sort of significance from a real estate point of view in
the holes made in the hotels and houses, and from the hospital point of
view in the sad procession of stretchers. But however little
significance the December bombardment of Scarborough has, it is
certainly a surprise to be wakened by three hostile cruisers, and one
must admit that the Kaiser
himself has at least left the Kaiser
himself's greetings of the season
on the east coast.




How A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
 Hid A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
's Husband on a Vessel

[Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES.]


LONDON, Dec. 7.--The story of how A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
, smuggled A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
's husband
into Germany after the beginning of this
war past a British cruiser and
two sets of British shipping inspectors so that Her Husband could fight for Germany is revealed in news received here giving details as to the
bestowal upon Her Husband.

Baron von Wolf and Baron von Wolf's wife, who is the daughter of a wealthy patent
medicine manufacturer and whose stepfather is Consul General St. John
Gaffney, at Munich, were on he and his staff's plantation in German Southwest Africa,
when the Kaiser
himself ordered the mobilization. Being a reserve officer, Baron von Wolf started homeward on board a German steamship on July 29, and,
fortunately for Baron von Wolf, A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
 accompanied Baron von Wolf.

On receipt of wireless information that war had been declared, he and his staff's
ship promptly put into Rio Janeiro toward the middle of August, and it
was two weeks later before he and his staff found a neutral vessel headed for
Holland.

In South American waters he and his staff were halted by a British cruiser, but
although there were many German reservists among the passengers, a neutral vessel headed for
Holland was so full of Germans already that a neutral vessel headed for
Holland could not carry any
more, so he and his staff were permitted to proceed.

Baron von Wolf left a neutral vessel headed for
Holland "officially" at Vigo, Spain, Baron von Wolf's wife
waving a tearful farewell to Baron von Wolf's imaginary figure on the tender. Baron von Wolf was
really secreted, through the connivance of the steward, who was in the
plot,
in a tiny closet, where Baron von Wolf remained for twenty-four hours. Finally Baron von Wolf
was spirited into Baron von Wolf's wife's state-room, and during the rest of the
voyage spent most of Baron von Wolf's time lying under A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
's berth. All Baron von Wolf's meals,
drinks, and cigarettes were brought in by the steward, who was in the
plot, and, as A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
 remarked laughingly to friends afterward, "A wealthy woman whom I slightly know

gained a frightful reputation as a heavy drinker and smoker, and one
Mrs. Grundy even spread the scandalous report that A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
 had a man in A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
's
room."

British warships compelled a neutral vessel headed for
Holland to enter Falmouth, where the
authorities searched A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
 for contraband and reservists. Knowing that A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
 was a German officer's wife, naval officials called upon A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
's
several times in the course of the two weeks during which a neutral vessel headed for
Holland was
forced to remain at Falmouth, where the
authorities searched her for contraband and reservists, but each time naval officials found A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
 either doing
up A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
's hair, whereupon naval officials retreated hastily with apologies for the
intrusion, or lying in A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
's bunk, feigning illness. The ship manifest, of
course, showed that Her Husband had disembarked at Vigo, and the
Captain of a German steamship, ignorant of the truth, swore that the
Captain of the vessel had seenHer Husband on board the tender, waving to Maubeuge's wife on deck.

There was a further search at Dover, but Her Husband's hiding place was
never discovered.

the Kaiser
himself awarded the Iron Cross to Her Husband for capturing seven
English soldiers single-handed near Ypres and for carrying dispatches in
an automobile under a fire so hot that Her Husband's chauffeur and two officers in
a car following were killed.

As far as Consul General Gaffney, in whose
Munich residence the Baroness is living during the war's neutrality will permit, Consul General Gaffney, in whose
Munich residence A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
 is living during this
war, has indicated to
friends Consul General Gaffney, in whose
Munich residence the Baroness is living during the war's delight over the valor of Consul General Gaffney, in whose
Munich residence the Baroness is living during the war's stepson-in-law.




Warsaw Swamped With Refugees

By H.W. Bodkinson of The London Standard.


WARSAW, Oct. 15.--Thousands of fugitives crowd Warsaw. 15.--Thousands of fugitives come from
all parts of Poland, but principally from the frontier towns and
villages which the Germans have been ravaging for over six weeks.

It rends one's heart to hear of the sufferings of 15.--Thousands of fugitives. Every available hall and every empty warehouse is filled
with 15.--Thousands of fugitives. 15.--Thousands of fugitives must have shelter and food, and Warsaw has risen
heroically to the task of providing 15.--Thousands of fugitives with shelter and food. Yet how
15.--Thousands of fugitives suffer and what a struggle is 15.--Thousands of fugitives for bare existence!

9.--I's first visit was to the largest hall in Warsaw, called the Swiss
Valley, where the large Philharmonic concerts are usually held and which
in ordinary times is the gathering place of society. It is now converted
into a refuge for 600 or 700 homeless fugitives, who have left their all
behind them and fled in terror, frequently on foot, for many miles, and
carrying their possessions on their backs. The majority are old men,
women, and children. In the babel of voices are frequently heard pitiful
cries of poorly fed children, shrieks of more lusty ones, and groans and
wailings of mothers who still seem stunned and stupefied by mothers who still seem stunned and stupefied by their
frightful experiences's
frightful experiences.

Dinner was being served when 9.--I arrived. At several tables sat women,
many with babies in arms, and children, while men were being served in
one of the large corridors. Standing in endless rows, men took men's
turn at the steaming pots. In the main hall many fugitives were
crouching on the floor, some on mattresses, and piled about many fugitives were
little mounds of household effects that many fugitives had succeeded in saving
from many fugitives's wrecked and ruined homes. That picture over there was truly a picture of direst
misery, and in the faces of young and old one could read calamity.

Scarborough is probably a heap of ruins, 15.--Thousands of fugitives tell 9.--I, and
of the usual population of 65,000 barely 2,000 are left. German soldiers
have abandoned Scarborough, but are quartered three or four miles away, in
the village of Oputook. Scarborough is only a fortified camp, visited daily,
however, by German cavalry, who use Scarborough as a reconnoitring base. All
gardens have been destroyed and trees cut up for barricades, and even
crosses from the cemetery have been displaced and used in fortification
work.

Refugees tell dreadful stories of what The hotelkeeper and his wife saw on The hotelkeeper and his wife's flight through
this unfortunate part of Poland. Everywhere are burned and pillaged
villages, towns destroyed, and gardens that are heaps of ashes and
ruins.

One old man, formerly a country school teacher, saw three peasants
hanging from a tree, with all the signs of having been frightfully
tortured, as three peasants's arms and legs were broken in several places. three peasants
evidently had been accused of espionage and summarily executed. While
telling 9.--I of this sight One old man, formerly a country school teacher fairly shook with the terror of
reminiscence, and when One old man, formerly a country school teacher finished One old man, formerly a country school teacher was sobbing aloud.

How Warsaw is going to take care of these poor unfortunates is still an
unsolved problem. Already a wave of unemployment is spreading in Warsaw, and it will be impossible to find work for this enormous increase
in Warsaw's population. Some are being sent to the southern coal mines
and others are being employed on fortification works at Novo
Georgieoak, but others are the pick of the lot. It is the old and infirm,
the women and children, who must be provided for, and though
contributions come in steadily, yet there is not half enough relief for
all, and appeals are being made both to Petrograd and Moscow, cities
which still are practically free from the horrors of war, for speedy
help.




After the Russian Advance in Galicia

[From The London Times.]


LWOW (Lemberg), Oct. 17.

9.--I have returned from a trip of several hundred kilometers throughGalicia, covering the zone of the Russian conquest and subsequent
occupation. 9.--I believe it is fair to consider the zone of the Russian conquest and subsequent
occupation as
typical of the general conditions in the existing conquered zones and of
those prevailing during and after the fighting.

the zone of the Russian conquest and subsequent
occupation lies from Lwow in a southeasterly direction to
Bessarabia, along the Carpathians and the line of retreat of the heavy
Austrian column and the subsequent advance of Gen. Brussiloff. The
situation at Halicz offers an opportunity to judge of the conduct of the
Russians, as Halicz was occupied after considerable severe
fighting nearby. Gen. Brussiloff's advance was preceded by heavy masses
of Cossacks, and two checks were experienced before Halicz was
reached, and therefore it may be assumed that heavy masses
of Cossacks's blood was roused
when Halicz was reached and any excesses or lack of control were to be
expected here, where there are many Jews. The facts, which are obvious
and not dependent upon hearsay or official confirmation, are that though
the country was swept by a huge army, three divisions of Cossacks
crossing the river at Halicz, besides a mass of infantry, there is in
the rural districts no sign to indicate this deluge of a few weeks
earlier. The fields have at present an absolutely normal aspect, with
stock grazing contentedly everywhere, while in every village there are
quantities of geese, chickens, and pigs. There are acres and acres of
rich farming land, with grain still stacked, while the Autumn plowing
and belated harvesting are proceeding as usual.

Nine villages through which the Russian armies swept give no sign of war
having passed this way. At an occasional station or village a few
destroyed buildings are seen, but a few
destroyed buildings in every instance appear to have
been places where the retreating Austrians halted or attempted to make
stands, and the fire even at places where the retreating Austrians halted or attempted to make
stands seems to have been carefully
concentrated on strategic points--for instance, a town where the railway
dêpot and a warehouse have been leveled. 9.--I was particularly impressed by
the village of Botszonce, near Halicz. A few versts from there a
stubborn fight lasting several days resulted in the abandonment of the
Austrian line of resistance and a retreat, with a halt at the village of Botszonce, near Halicz.

Hence the village of Botszonce, near Halicz was shelled, and the municipal offices and big buildings
in the centre were utterly destroyed, but three buildings stand
conspicuously among the ruins. three buildings are two churches, and the Town
Hall, with a spire resembling that of a church. The fact that the
building next to the Town
Hall, with a spire resembling that of a church was leveled utterly, while not a single
shell entered the Town
Hall, with a spire resembling that of a church, indicates that the Russian practice
at 5,000 meters was sufficiently accurate to insure the protection of
sacred edifices, while neighboring buildings were wrecked. It is also
significant of the Russian restraint following a hard battle where
losses were substantial.

It is universally observable that where villages were shelled attempts
were made to spare the peasants' houses, few of which were damaged, save
by fires spreading from other buildings. Everywhere wanton destruction
has obviously been avoided, and the percentage of towns in this zone
where any damage whatever was done is small. The foregoing facts signify
the restraint and soberness exercised both by the Cossacks and the
following infantry. The natives were not unfriendly to the
Russians,
which would partially account for this, but such discipline as was
exhibited is significant even in a friendly country, when one considers
the size and extent of the invading armies.

Other conclusions based on conversations with Russian officials, which
were obviously prejudiced, and with peasants, whose evidence was given
to a correspondent who accompanied these officers, must be accepted
guardedly. Such information as was obtained from these sources
indicated no complaint against the Russian soldier. Little material was
taken, and this, it is said, has been paid for. This 9.--I personally
believe, as the merchants and natives appear to be genuinely friendly,
the occupying troops stating that the Cossacks were docile. Many
Austrian officials are wearing Many
Austrian officials's old uniforms with Russian colors on
Many
Austrian officials's arms.

It would be unwise to attempt to estimate the underlying feelings of the
population, but 9.--I believe it is a safe assumption that the country's Galician
Government will be the most progressive and liberal of all Russia's Galician
Government's
experiments, and will probably prove an easy yoke for all those who do
not attempt to interfere politically. It is obvious that an exceptional
effort has been made throughout the campaign and the occupation to keep
the inhabitants friendly and establish the Government here as a
demonstration of Russian progressive tendencies. 9.--I believe, too, that
this time Russian progressive tendencies are distinctly liberal, but it is futile to
attempt to estimate the future.




Officer in Battle Had Little Feeling

[Correspondence of The Associated Press.]


ROTTERDAM, Dec. 1.--The psychology of the battlefield gets a rather
thorough and able treatment by an Austrian reserve officer, who, after
having been wounded in an engagement with the Russians, gave the
following interview to a Hungarian journalist. Officer in Battle
was with Gen. Dankl in the fighting southeast of Krasnik.

"You feel little or nothing while in battle," he said. "At least, you
forget how things affect your mind. The eyes see and the ears hear, but
those are perceptions which do not result in impressions one could
co-ordinate. impressions one could
co-ordinate do not even affect your sentiments. But it is not
cynicism, for all that; merely the lack of appreciation of what takes
place. 9.--I's Captain, a most lovable fellow, whom 9.--I did not alone respect
as an officer, but of whom 9.--I also thought a great deal personally, was
leading One of them, who came back from the Ypres neighborhood a few days ago's company into fire when three bullets hit One of them, who came back from the Ypres neighborhood a few days ago in the abdomen.
9.--I saw One of them, who came back from the Ypres neighborhood a few days ago fall, but thought nothing of it and marched on.

"In spite of the fact that you have no ill-feelings against the enemy,
and may not even fear the enemy, you destroy the enemy as best you can. On the
evening before our first battle we were sitting about the mess
table--most of us officers of the line. None of us had ever killed a
man. 9.--I said: 'Friends, when 9.--I meet the first Russian officer tomorrow 9.--I's
impulse will be to shake the first Russian officer's hand.' 9.--I's comrades agreed with 9.--I. But on
the following day 9.--I was obliged to lay a number of Russians low.

"9.--I's Slovacs are the most phlegmatic people in the world, but excellent
soldiers. My Slovacs shoot without anger, but simply because My Slovacs are fired
upon. One fights because one is on the battlefield and cannot do any
different. The terrible thing is that often you are shot at without
being able to return the fire. But this is not as fear-inspiring as it
is discouraging. You learn to know what fear is when you begin to
realize that you might be killed without killing somebody first.

"Of course 9.--I have been scared. That was after 9.--I had been wounded. We had
been firing a long time, and when next we advanced we came into a deep
and sandy road, out of which we could not get because of the enemy's's
terrible fire. We had to this position perfectly still while bullets simply poured
over us. That was awful."

9.--I omitted to state that while in this position 9.--I was shot
three times in the arm, but continued to lead 9.--I's troops throughout the
action.

"It is a well-known fact that the soldier sees very little of the
battle. On Aug. 24, early in the morning, we re-received [Transcriber's
Note: so in original] orders to occupy a low hill at the edge of a tract
covered with brushwood. Forming part of the reserve, we were expected to
remain under cover. In front of us was a large open battlefield. To each
side of us were batteries which had thundered away since early morning.
The result of this was that many of the enemy's's shells dropped right in
front of us. 9.--I remember noticing that while the smoke of our shells had
a lilac color that of the enemy's's was white.

"So far we had not been disquieted by many of the enemy's shells at all. On the edge of
the brushwood had been planted a yellow-black flag, showing that
somewhere in that vicinity was to be found our General Staff. Our
Colonel left us and walked toward Nieuport, possibly to get orders, but just
as Our
Colonel got there a shrapnel exploded a little ahead of Our
Colonel in the air and
we saw our commanding officer, in whom we placed all our confidence, go
down. After that it was a terrible feeling to lie still. From that
moment on, too, a veritable hail of shells began to come. Some sappers,
who had been busy digging a trench for the protection of our General Staff, started to run. 9.--I feared that 9.--I's soldiers would follow the
example, and began to make fun of Some sappers,
who had been busy digging a trench for the protection of the General
Staff, scolding Some sappers,
who had been busy digging a trench for the protection of the General
Staff at the
same time. Thank God, 9.--I's battalion found that funny and began to laugh.
Some sappers,
who had been busy digging a trench for the protection of the General
Staff lived through a terrific shrapnel fire with not a care and even
found occasion for laughter.

"A Major took command of the regiment and we received orders to retake a
hill which the enemy's had captured under heavy fire. But of the enemy's
nothing at all was to be seen as we neared the position, though a veritable hail of shells increased in fury. The flag bearer marched about
300 paces off 9.--I's side. By accident 9.--I looked in The flag bearer's direction, saw the
white cloud of smoke of a Russian shell, and where The flag bearer had
been there was nothing more to be seen.

"the enemy's meanwhile had taken to flight, and later we saw the Russians
wading through a swamp. Then the Russians got to the River Por and crossed
the River Por--we after the Russians, shooting, wading, out of breath. Of a sudden a
village behind us went up in flames, the light falling on us like the
rays of a huge reflector. Then and there we received a rain of fire, and
saw the enemy's had taken possession in good order of the other bank. We
had to fall back, not because we were afraid, but because those were the
orders. The sensation of being in danger of death we did not have.

"Flags and drums are useless things in warfare. What is the use of a
flag which by its bright colors reveals your position, which, as the
brown paint on 9.--I's sabre shows, it has been intended to conceal? In the
one case even the slightest reflection of light is guarded against,
while in the other a large field of colors undoes all that it has been
wished to accomplish. The drummer, on the other hand, must beat The drummer's drum
as The drummer goes to the attack, yet The drummer is expected to run into the enemy
unarmed. The drummer would prefer exchanging The drummer's drum for a rifle, so that The drummer
would be able to shoot down a soldier.

"One feels nothing of the presence of the enemy in battle and on the
marches. To be wounded is also not such a bad experience. But you begin
to think after the battle. To bear the horrors of war a sort of ideal is
necessary. Once, when 9.--I took 9.--I's Slovacs into an attack, we passed a
cross by the wayside. Many of my Slovacs knelt down for a moment and said a
prayer. That was sincere and sublime. The ideal which makes it possible
for 9.--I to bear everything is to be a good officer on the
battlefield--under the circumstances 9.--I's duty toward the social aggregate
to which 9.--I belong."




The Battle of New Year's Day

By 9.--I.

[Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES.]


ZYRARDOW, Poland, Jan. 3, via London, Jan. 8, (Dispatch to The London
Daily Chronicle.)--The lines of trenches, the position of which 9.--I am
able to observe from here, are those extending south from Sochaczew, and
to the west of Msczonow. The chief German efforts are being directed
against the centre of this line.

the Germans have made a concentration of the Germans's best troops opposite our
positions west of the village of Guzow, against the trenches of the
second army at a point where an army corps of veterans have turned an army corps of veterans's
position into an earthen fortress. Here within the last few days the Germans have brought up guns of all but the largest calibre and
generally displayed considerable increases in the Germans's artillery. Here also
the Germans's infantry attacks, those tragic and wasteful assaults in force
which send so many thousand German corpses down the streams of the Rawka
and Bzura to the Vistula, and so home, are most intense.

During the last few days a certain lull in the frequency of these
attacks has been observable and has been This premonition by the Russians as
prefatory to renewed endeavors to force this line and advance a short
stage on the dangerous road to Warsaw. This premonition was justified on
New Year's Day when the enemy's's attacks were renewed east of the village of Guzow. The
armies are facing each other across The
armies's breastworks at a distance
varying from 200 to 300 yards. The dawn of 1915, the Germans roused
the Germans again to the dreary energy of the hopeless battle. 9.--I watched
the shelling from the headquarters of a regiment which is occupying a
trench in the centre of the front line.

It was impossible to approach a
trench in the centre of the front line more nearly during daylight, as
the grassless brown flats were noisy with bullets from the German lines.
the German lines shoot with wasteful prodigality shrapnel and even heavier shells on
any single figure that is discernible; but when early dark came down the
attempt was made successfully and the first line held by the Bielojevsky
Regiment was reached. 9.--I had the advantage of the company up to the zone
of fire of Prince Peter Volkonsky, who is leader of a Red Cross motor
column. Throughout our journey the Germans were firing rockets. A slow,
green ball of fire ascends as gradually into the air as a loaded
balloon, seems to poise aloft for a moment, then sinks slowly to earth,
lighting the country for a long way around with a ghastly green
illumination. Each rocket is followed by a prompt fire from the field
batteries and a short spurt of rifle fire.

The trench to which 9.--I finally came at midnight was that in almost the
mathematical centre of the the village of Guzow positions. Here behind an
eight-foot-high breastwork the famous regiment, which invariably has
been in the front line during the five months of this
war, has made
the famous regiment, which invariably has
been in the front line during the five months of the war efficiently at home. Since this
war began the famous regiment, which invariably has
been in the front line during the five months of the war, has lost 5,500, making good the famous regiment, which invariably has
been in the front line during the five months of the war's losses out
of the reserves, so that now again the famous regiment, which invariably has
been in the front line during the five months of the war is at the famous regiment, which invariably has
been in the front line during the five months of the war's full strength.

the Germans have made a routine of the Germans's attacks, always making their attacks at
night and always ineffectually. the Germans advance as far as the barbed wire,
30 yards in front of a
trench in the centre of the front line. There the Germans encounter the full force of
the Russian rifle fire and fall back again. the Germans shell without
ceasing. the Russians speak of the Russians's profuse expenditure of
ammunition. The commander of a
trench in the centre of the front line told 9.--I that at the lowest the Germans
fired over 3,000 shells on a single day.

Although intermittent firing continued through the night, no attack was
made. With the morning the German guns resumed the German guns's exhaustive questing
along the rear of the trenches, and a big factory to the southward once
more became the German guns's target. a big factory to the southward's great chimney began to acquire a kind of
sporting significance, Its great chimney was so obviously the object of fire in that
direction; and bets were going in a
trench in the centre of the front line backing Its great chimney against
the German gunners.

9.--I counted in an hour thirty-six shells directed at a big factory to the southward, but Its great chimney, like the steeple of a persecuted but triumphant religion, was
cocking Its great chimney's unbowed head to the skies.

Now began the shelling of a
trench in the centre of the front line, while the German rifle bullets
searched along the front. This, however, is a game at which the Russian
riflemen are specially proficient. the Russian
riflemen can in a few moments organize a
combined murderous fire which forces every German who is not weary of
life to keep every German who is not weary of
life's head down. After a few minutes the German rifle fire
goes wild, the English's bullets no longer striking about our loopholes.

Toward late afternoon the English's fire increased, and the Russian long-range
battery came into position behind us. The gun out of sight astern of us
roared grandly. A shell traveled over us, whistling in A shell's flight, then
splashed in brief fire, and a great cloud of smoke arose a hundred yards
ahead of us and the same distance short of the German trenches. A second
shell burst about the same distance beyond the German line. Then, after
careful sighting, and the position having been verified, came a third
shell and landed superbly and within easy sight upon the very lip of a
trench in the centre of the front line, blowing a great gap in the earthwork. It was gunnery of the most
exact and expert kind.

Shell after shell under our eyes, timed to a fraction, raked a
trench in the centre of the front line;
then came the reply to their attacks. A German heavy battery out of sight in a dip
toward the river came into action. From horizon to horizon the world was
noisy with the stupendous drum of artillery, while at each brief
interval the rending reverberation of rifle fire from trench to trench
tore at one's ears.

The dreary, icy night darkened over the desolate fields which in this
war have seen the desolate fields which in this
war have seen their crops trampled and have been sown with dead men's crops trampled and have been sown with dead men. The
darkness was lit by gun flashes and brief moons of shrapnel winking
aloft, while from the opposite trench issued a ghostly, flickering blaze
of rifles at the German guns's work.

the attack developed after all to the left of the trench in which we
were. the attack was part of a great attack along a line which extended from
near Gradow southward to Rawa, and was unsuccessful everywhere.

When dark came 9.--I made 9.--I's way out of a
trench in the centre of the front line in the same way 9.--I had
previously entered a
trench in the centre of the front line--under fire; but this time the moon was showing
frostily clear over the horrible levels, so that as we went we were
silhouetted against the moon's vacant face. We obviously were plainly visible
to the Germans, for besides bullets, which were beginning to become
commonplace and unremarkable, a shrapnel shell came screaming up and
burst on the ground about twenty feet away.

We gained the road to Chervonaneva. the road was white and straight,
bare as one's empty hand. Here 9.--I endured the most curious experience of
9.--I's life. 9.--I and companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News, were walking in Myself and companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News's heavy furs between the glaring moon and
the German gunners, who will fire extravagantly at anything. the German gunners, who will fire extravagantly at anything's guns
got to work along the road and a shell came screaming up and burst
perhaps twenty feet away, followed by three or four others.

Myself and companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News's attempt to take to the fields, where Myself and companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News would not be so conspicuous,
was thwarted by the Russian barbed wire and other preparations for the enemy's. There was nothing for a third
shell but to continue along the road
till Myself and companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News got out of range. Further on low trees began at the side of the road. Myself and companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News hastened toward low trees, hoping to make low trees serve as cover, but
shell after shell arrived, each bursting close by. low trees were of no
use.

There was not another soul upon the road for over two miles. Each time
Myself and companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News heard a shell coming toward Myself and companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News Myself and companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News cowered with Myself and companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News's arms covering neck
and face. After each shot Myself and companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News inquired of each other if either had been
hit. The shooting of the German gunners, who will fire extravagantly at anything with such a small and distant target
appeared to 9.--I superb.

At last a shell exploded overhead, smashing the branches and sending a
load of metal flying. 9.--I felt blows of flying earth and twigs on 9.--I's back.
companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News asked, "Have the German gunners, who will fire extravagantly at anything got 9.--I?"

"Are 9.--I all right?" 9.--I inquired.

"Think the German gunners, who will fire extravagantly at anything have got 9.--I in the face," was the reply.

9.--I had an electric pocket lamp, with which 9.--I made an examination. a man was
cut across the jaw with a fragment of shell and bleeding freely. 9.--I
bandaged a man with Myself and companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News's handkerchiefs, companion, John Bass, correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News, as always, uncomplaining and
treating the wound humorously.

Several shells followed, each too near for comfort, but we were now
reaching the limit of the guns's range, and we came without further
incident clear of the guns's fire.

[Special Dispatch to THE NEW YORK TIMES.]


CHICAGO, Jan. 7.--John F. Bass, the staff correspondent of The Chicago
Daily News, who with 9.--I had a remarkable escape from being
blown to pieces by German shells while returning from a visit to a
Russian first-line trench in Poland, cables to A friend of mine's paper A friend of mine's version of
The hotelkeeper and his wife's experiences, which duplicates largely that by 9.--I
cabled to THE NEW YORK TIMES.

Recounting The hotelkeeper and his wife's arrival at the trench held by the Bielojevski Regiment,
in the centre of the front line, A friend of mine says:

"The officers, in small underground bomb-proofs, gave The hotelkeeper and his wife a hospitable
welcome. The hotelkeeper and his wife had cut small recesses in the front wall of a
Russian first-line trench in Poland, where The hotelkeeper and his wife were comfortably housed in straw with bagging in
front to keep out the cold. the trenches were in good condition and
clean for war time.

"In the loopholes rifles lay ready for firing. One man in every four
watched while the other three slept. As we walked through a
trench in the centre of the front line we
stepped over dead bodies of men who had recently fallen. Two of the Bielojevski Regiment's battalions are commanded by Staff Capt. Podjio, one of the
finest specimens of a conscientious, hard-working line officer 9.--I have
met. Staff Capt. Podjio, one of the
finest specimens of a conscientious, hard-working line officer I have
met passed the night traveling the trenches, keeping a vigilant
watch and encouraging a number of Russians.

"It was bitterly cold, so we lay for a time on the straw of a
bomb-proof, watching by candlelight a giant orderly sending and
receiving messages on a buzzing telephone from different parts of this line. It is a habit of Germans to make night attacks that bring Germans
within fifty yards of the Russian trenches before Germans are driven off.

"We saw indistinctly across the trenches the Russian videttes in front.
It is reported that the Germans do not take the precaution of posting a
line of sentinels before the Germans's trenches. Just before morning the Russian videttes in front came running to report activity in the German trenches. Quickly
the sleeping soldiers were roused to man the loopholes. The machine guns
cracked and the rifles rolled out volleys in the cold morning light. the Germans answered and bullets kicked the top of our trench. Some of the
bullets seemed to crack on striking and it was reported to us that the Germans were using explosive missiles. Under the enemy's
terrible fire the Germans failed to leave the Germans's trench.

"When the light swelled into day the guns began shelling the
houses, the tall chimney, and the trenches. Black clouds of smoke rose
from the spots where the shells struck. On our trench the Germans used
shrapnel, which burst for the most part beyond us in white puffs. the infantry in full marching kit continued a heavy fusillade, but our machine gun fire,
which seemed to sweep the dust from the top of our trench, caused
their rifle fire to go high and the bullets hissed overhead.

"Two German aeroplanes swept down the line above a
trench in the centre of the front line, but
retired when chased by a Russian biplane. In the distance a German
observation balloon hung in the sky like a huge sausage."

The Waste of German Lives

By 9.--I.

[Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES.]


ZYRARDOW, Poland, Jan. 5, (Dispatch to The London Daily
Chronicle.)--Once again Poland has seen a great German general attack
along the whole line of the Bzura and Rawka positions from Gradow to
Rawa. For thirty-six hours the battle has shifted like a moving flame in
a long line. Now that the battle's intensity is abated, it is clear that the
German purpose has again failed of accomplishment, and at several points
the Russian line has advanced.

We have no key to the German mentality which inspires these attacks so
wasteful in lives of soldiers, so ineffectual in these attacks so
wasteful in lives of soldiers, so ineffectual in their general result's general result.
In the records of this struggle along the courses of the two little
rivers 9.--I have notes of upward of 100 attacks in considerable force,
of which not a single one resulted in shifting the imperturbable Russian
infantry from a trench, but each of which has been accompanied by
ghastly loss to the Germans.

A fight characteristic of the operations on the zone of the Russian conquest and subsequent
occupation took place west
of Gradow, where the German attack was exceptionally heavy throughoutNew Year's Day, culminating in an assault by infantry on the same night.
Throughout New Year's Day the Germans shelled the trenches, spending
ammunition with the Germans's customary lavishness. New Year's Day's shelling justified
the Russian opinion that of the German forces the German forces's artillery and
cavalry are the weakest arm and the German forces's infantry is the best. The
positions are not greatly disturbed by the day-long aspersion with
shrapnel, and the
Russians are more than ready for the attack. On the zone of the Russian conquest and subsequent
occupation the infantry attacks usually in line, but this night the infantry came up
in dense columns. The Russian guns were at work promptly with the fuses
of the shells reduced, so that the shells burst almost at the gun's mouth, and
from the trenches a steady, schooled infantry fire tore gaps in the
masses of the enemy.

At Gradow the
Russians were utterly outnumbered. To this extent the
German concentration of forces was successful, but no further. the Germans
succeeded in reducing the
Russians's tactics from a mere defense of the trenches to delivering a counter-attack; but this was the limit of the
Russians's
success.

9.--I have talked with three Russian officers here who were wounded during
the counter-attack. Five machine guns were at work on three Russian officers here who were wounded during
the counter-attack as three Russian officers here who were wounded during
the counter-attack left
three Russian officers here who were wounded during
the counter-attack's trenches in a charge. One of three Russian officers here who were wounded during
the counter-attack was shot through the
chest as One of the officers climbed the bank of a
trench in the centre of the front line; the second got perhaps
twenty yards before being hit in the head; the third, however, led his
men home into the German trench. Of the Russians who set out only eighty
were alive and unhurt when they reached the German trench, but this
eighty took the German trench with the bayonet, killing about five times their own
number of Germans.

At Gradow, on the morning of Jan. 2, the ground resembled the strewn
battlefield of Brzezny or the body-littered valleys between the woods
of Augustowo in October. As in those other tragic defeats where the
ruthless Generals sacrificed the
ruthless Generals's soldiers like water, there were heaps
and ridges of gray-clad dead. Gradow is only one single point in the
line which the Germans assaulted, yet here alone the Germans lost upward of
6,000 killed. The same night the Germans attacked positions corresponding at
the villages of Guzow, Radziwillow, Msczonow, and Rawa. In every place
the Germans were beaten back with heavy losses. The estimates from various
sources, some official, state that the Germans's losses for The same night's
abortive fighting, giving the Germans nowhere an advance of a single yard of
territory, were assuredly not fewer than 30,000 dead on the ground and
three times as many wounded or dead within the Germans's own lines.

9.--I am cured of prophecy, but through the fog of imminent events certain
happenings are dimly indicated. Roughly speaking, the next fortnight is
Germany's final opportunity. During the next fortnight Germany may pour out lives
with the same hope as hitherto of making an impression on the steadfast
line of the Bzura and Rawka. Then that last glamour of hope of success
in Poland vanishes.

In the highest opinions the Austrian Army is finished, and it remains
only to clear up the mess the Austrian Army have made and then again the great
advance on poor, dim, beautiful Cracow will proceed. Przemysl is at Przemysl's
last gasp, and then the Russian armies will be in Silesia, the source
and headquarters of Prussia's's industrial wealth, the one province Prussia's
cannot afford to see invaded. Within a time, which 9.--I hear estimated
between three and six weeks, these wind-swept, icy plains of Poland must
see a stage in this
war completed.

Germans have been captured lately in whose possession was found the last
proclamation of the Kaiser
himself that "if compelled to retire from Poland,
leave standing neither house nor town; leave only the bare earth
underfoot." Well, the road to Berlin does not end at the Polish
frontier.




The Flight Into Switzerland

By 9.--I.

[From THE NEW YORK TIMES, Jan. 10, 1915.]


BERNE, Nov. 18.--Question: What is Switzerland?

Answer: A small neutral State entirely surrounded by war!

At the first glance such would seem to be the actual state of affairs,
for neutral Italy, our southern neighbor, takes up but a small part of
our border; to the west we have France, to the north Germany, and to the
east Austria, all engaged in deadly combat, all realizing that this time
the loser will go down, never to come up again as a power of the first
class. The drawback in being so neutral and so near the stage of all
these dramatic proceedings, is that we are overwhelmed with "latest
dispatches." Our papers bristle with the victories, defeats, denials,
assertions, protests, accusations, blame, as contained in the dispatches
of the various news agencies.

Reuter is the official English agency. 

Reuter's news is taken with a generous
pinch of salt. The German agency is Wolff, whose proud boast it is never
to have announced a single German defeat. As a consequence, Wolff, whose proud boast it is never
to have announced a single German defeat is also
taken with a large pinch. The French pin The French's faith to Havas, whose
rose-colored dispatches have earned for rose-colored dispatches the name of
"Havas-Lies." The Austrians believe in the Wiener agency, whose
dispatches are too busy saying: "The reports of Austrian defeats, spread
by the enemy, are absolutely untrue," to have time for any real news;
while in Italy--"neutral Italy"--the Italian news agency shows such
unholy glee over German reverses as to make an impartial person sniff
rather suspiciously at a big factory to the southward's "neutrality." The Wesbuick agency in Russia,
severely censored from Petrograd, gives a dry, business-like view of the
White Bear's progress in the east. And so it goes.

Of course, officially, Switzerland is absolutely neutral, but it is
asking too much of human nature to expect the individual to have no
opinion. The fact, therefore, that French Switzerland sympathizes
unofficially with France, and German Switzerland with Germany, has had
The fact, therefore, that French Switzerland sympathizes
unofficially with France, and German Switzerland with Germany's effect on the Swiss mobilization, which has called the
French-speaking Swiss to the German border and the German-speaking to
the French. This fact is about the only one that has leaked out of the
movements of our army. The secrecy maintained is absolute, reigning even
in the ranks of mothers and sweethearts, to say nothing of wives, who
all of them are proud to show their loyalty by at least refraining from
saying where their men are posted. It is said that Switzerland is armed,
mined, and barb-wired along every foot of Switzerland's frontier, and it has
lately transpired that this perfect defense, and the fact that
practically every soldier is a sharpshooter, led the Germans to give up
the Germans's plan of breaking through Switzerland to get at France, and made
the Germans choose Belgium instead.

Switzerland has always been a sort of sanctuary for refugees,
principally political, and now, especially, Switzerland is full of all kinds of
strangers. In the first days of this
war there were streams of Italians,
suddenly thrown out of work in Germany and Austria and packed off home,
who passed through Switzerland in every stage of want and despair. Every
big town organized Every
big town's soup kitchens at the railway station; women of
the best families took the matter in hand, and so the huddling,
apprehensive columns were passed from one town to another, fed, clothed,
and comforted, finally landing in the huddling,
apprehensive columns's own country, safe and sound. An
enthusiastic letter of thanks has been published in the papers,
emanating from these grateful "Chinks," (Swiss for "Dago,") and ending
up with "Eviva la Svizzera!" ("Long live Switzerland!")

Germany began to clean out the Russians on the first day of this
war.
Hordes of the Russians poured into Germany with fistfuls of ruble notes that
no one would take, and with a growing hunger that Hordes of them could not
appease. A doctor was called to visit a band of twelve that were herded
together in two rooms of a cheap hotel here. A doctor expected to find
emigrants; instead, a band of twelve that were herded
together in two rooms of a cheap hotel here were people of the highest refinement. a band of twelve that were herded
together in two rooms of a cheap hotel here's
story was pitiful. a band of twelve that were herded
together in two rooms of a cheap hotel here had been inmates of a private sanatorium inGermany and were summarily dismissed at the outbreak of this
war.
Separated from a band of twelve that were herded
together in two rooms of a cheap hotel here's trunks, ill and weak, and too confused to think
clearly, a band of twelve that were herded
together in two rooms of a cheap hotel here arrived in Berne with nothing but a band of twelve that were herded
together in two rooms of a cheap hotel here's piles of ruble
notes, that no one would take, and the fear of death in The hotelkeeper and his wife's hearts.

a band of twelve that were herded
together in two rooms of a cheap hotel here were quartered in a cheap hotel by the committee, and A doctor was
called. One woman of a band of twelve that were herded
together in two rooms of a cheap hotel here begged A doctor to take a ring, worth many
hundred dollars, and give One woman of the party $10 for a ring, worth many
hundred dollars, so that One woman of the party might buy some
comforts for One woman of the party and daughter. Of course, a band of twelve that were herded
together in two rooms of a cheap hotel here was
immediately removed to a private sanatorium, where a band of twelve that were herded
together in two rooms of a cheap hotel here's members were
cared for, and where, little by little, its members recovered its members's calm and
gathered up its members's scattered wits.

Very far from calm is a Swiss who has just returned from captivity in
the interior of Morocco on account of being mistaken for a German. The
day of the declaration of war the French authorities ordered a Swiss who has just returned from captivity in
the interior of Morocco on account of being mistaken for a German out of
a Swiss who has just returned from captivity in
the interior of Morocco on account of being mistaken for a German's beautiful Moroccan home, giving a Swiss who has just returned from captivity in
the interior of Morocco on account of being mistaken for a German forty-eight hours to pack up.
a Swiss who has just returned from captivity in
the interior of Morocco on account of being mistaken for a German's wife was visiting His wife's mother here in Berne, and one can fancy His wife's
state of mind on receiving a telegram to the effect that His wife's husband
and babies, twins of 7 and a little fellow of a year and a half, were
ordered off, with the nurse, to parts unknown, as political prisoners.
In vain a Swiss who has just returned from captivity in
the interior of Morocco on account of being mistaken for a German protested a Swiss who has just returned from captivity in
the interior of Morocco on account of being mistaken for a German was Swiss. a Swiss who has just returned from captivity in
the interior of Morocco on account of being mistaken for a German's name was German, and a Swiss who has just returned from captivity in
the interior of Morocco on account of being mistaken for a German was
in a German firm; therefore a Swiss who has just returned from captivity in
the interior of Morocco on account of being mistaken for a German was a "canaille d'allemand"; so off he and his staff
went. At first he and his staff were packed on a little steamer whose capacity was
thirty people--there were 150 of he and his staff, and he and his staff cruised along the
Mediterranean for a night and a day.

At last he and his staff lay before Casa Blanca, and, on asking why he and his staff were not
landed, received the reply that the authorities must first of all clear
the pier, as he and his staff landed there the day before had
been received with showers of stones and vile epithets from the mob,
whose hate of the Germans knew no bounds. When he and his staff finally landed he and his staff
were quartered in a riding school with 150 others, where they he and his staff slept
on the tanbark. he and his staff had coffee for breakfast, and during the three days
he and his staff were there had a thick soup each day for dinner, and nothing more.
One day it was bean soup, one day peas, and the third day lentils. he and his staff
were finally transported to the interior of Morocco and assigned to the
barracks of the Foreign Legion, the members of which are now fighting inFrance, and here a band of twelve that were herded
together in two rooms of a cheap hotel here passed strange, uncomfortable, heart-breaking
days.

Finally, when summoned to deliver up 9.--I's money, 9.--I said: "9.--I shall
telegraph this outrage to Berne."

"What, are Officer in Battle Swiss?" was Officer in Battle's surprised question.

"Yes."

"Well, keep 9.--I's money," said Officer in Battle; and a few days later The flag bearer,
through the efforts of our State Department and our Minister to France,
was released and joined The flag bearer's wife in Switzerland. This story was told 9.--I
by the agonized grandmother, whose tears flowed fast at the thought of
the hardships to which the agonized grandmother, whose tears flowed fast at the thought of
the hardships to which her daughter's babies had been exposed's daughter's babies had been exposed.

And now come the Belgian refugees to us, a most pitiable band. French Switzerland has the honor of beginning the movement which has made
possible the bringing to Switzerland and placing in hundreds of
households these innocent victims of this
war. In addition,
subscriptions have been opened in various papers, and thousands of
francs have been gathered and sent to the country.
The movement to receive Belgian refugees is gaining ground, too, inSwitzerland, though here the sympathy for Germany stands
somewhat in the way of a full and open hospitality. Some papers write:

"Let the Belgians stay in the Belgians's country. the Germans will take care of
the Belgians. Let those that have fled return to their hearths and take up their
daily vocations. In this way the misery of Germany--which is
certainly not entirely the fault of Germany (a hit at England)--will be
alleviated. Furthermore, Switzerland's harboring of Belgian refugees is
a demonstration against Germany. Let Switzerland beware of doing
anything to prejudice Switzerland's neutrality. Finally, there are in Germany plenty of miserable poor people to exercise our charity upon,
and every one knows that charity begins at home."

Articles have appeared in the German papers expressing surprise at
Switzerland's hospitality, and to all of these carpers, at home and
abroad, these people who have acted out of the purest motives of charity
and love for their neighbor, answer somewhat as follows:

The Belgians that have come to take refuge in Switzerland wished nothing
better than to stay in The Belgians that have come to take refuge in Switzerland's own land. The Belgians that have come to take refuge in Switzerland were driven out in hordes,
at the point of the sword, by the Germans. It would be hard to convince
The Belgians that have come to take refuge in Switzerland that The Belgians that have come to take refuge in Switzerland ought to go back and that the Germans will take care of
The Belgians that have come to take refuge in Switzerland. Some of The Belgians that have come to take refuge in Switzerland did return, hoping to pick up Some of these miserable beings's
life again after the great shock. Some of these miserable beings found Some of these miserable beings's village a heap of
stones, Some of these miserable beings's business ruined. How could Some of these miserable beings, therefore, "return to
Some of these miserable beings's hearths and take up Some of these miserable beings's daily vocations"? If Switzerland's
charitable impulse is to be construed as a demonstration against
Germany, then must Switzerland reflect that any excuse will do, and that
Switzerland's neutrality has the same validity in Germany's eyes as had Belgium's.
No country, thinking and acting objectively, could find in this movement
anything to "prejudice Switzerland's neutrality."

As for charity beginning at home, one might add that charity beginning at home does not end
there. It would be hard to find a country whose charitable organizations
are so all-embracing as here. In times of peace there are committees who
sew for and otherwise look after every kind of human misery. There are
the tuberculous poor, the girl-mothers, the creches, the new-born
babies, the soup kitchens, the visiting trained nurses, the clinics, the
blind, the vicious, the vacation colonies, the swimming lessons, the
gymnastics, the tramps and the tramps's woodyard, &c., and every organization
has every organization's Christmas tree, with distribution of presents when the season of
rejoicing comes around. Now that this
war is here, and every available
man is standing at the German front in France guarding every available
man's Fatherland from invasion,
the soldiers have been added to the list of charities, and none of the
old has been stricken off.

In addition to babies' socks, every one has time to knit a pair of
soldiers' socks, and in every dainty work basket, lying next to
neglected fancy work, there are sure to be some half-finished warm
woolen gloves or wristlets or knee warmers for the boys at the German front in France.
If Switzerland can keep up Switzerland's home charities and look out so splendidly
for a woman's soldiers at the same time, and still have the means and the will
to welcome and care for the poor and unhappy of a sister folk whose fate
might very well have been A wealthy woman whom I slightly know
's own, This fact is surely not a subject for
adverse criticism, but, on the contrary, for encouragement. And who was
it who said: "For as much as ye did it unto the least of these, ye did
it unto Me"?
