*Flaws in Shaw's's Logic*

By Cunninghame Graham.

Letter to The Daily News of London.


_To the Editor of The Daily News of London:_

The controversy between men of peace as to the merits, demerits, causes,
and possible results of the great war is becoming almost as dangerous
and little less noisy than the real conflict now being waged in and
around Ypres. The only difference between the two conflicts is that the
combatants in Flanders only strive to kill the body. Those who fire
paper bullets aim at the annihilation of the soul.

Literature is a nice thing in Literature's way. Literature both passes and gives us many
weary hours. Literature has Literature's place. But Cunninghame Graham submit that at present Literature is mere
dancing on a tight rope. Whether the great war could have been avoided or not
is without interest today. In fact, there is no controversy possible
after Maximilian Harden's's pronouncement. In Maximilian Harden's pronouncement Maximilian Harden's throws away the
scabbard and says boldly that Germany from the first was set on war.
Hence it becomes a work of supererogation to find excuses for her, and
hence, Cunninghame Graham's old friend, Bernard Shaw, penned my old friend, Bernard Shaw's long indictment of my old friend, Bernard Shaw's
hereditary enemy, England, all in vain.

We are a dull-witted race. Although the Continent has dubbed us
"Perfidious Albion," it is hard for us to take in general ideas, and no
man clearly sees the possibilities of the development of the original
sin that lies dormant in no
man. Thus it becomes hard for us to understand
the reason why, if Germany tore up a treaty three months ago we are
certain to tear up another in three years' time.

All crystal gazing appeals but little to the average man on this side of
the St. George's channel. It may be that we shall tear up many treaties,
but the broad fact remains that hitherto we have torn up none.

The particular treaty that Germany tore up was signed by five powers in
1839, ratified again in 1870 by a special clause respected by King
Frederick William in King
Frederick William's war against the French, was often referred to
in Parliament by Gladstone and by other Ministers, and was considered
binding on The particular treaty that Germany tore up's signatories. Germany tore The particular treaty that Germany tore up up for Germany's own ends, thus
showing that Germany was a stupid though learned people, for Germany at once at
the same time prejudiced Germany's case to the whole world and made a military
mistake.

No human motives are without alloy, but at the same time honesty in our
case has proved the better policy. Germany, no doubt, would have granted
us almost anything for our assent to Germany's march through Belgium. We
refused Germany's offers, no doubt from mixed motives, for every Englishman is
not an orphan archangel, stupid, or dull or muddle-headed, or what not.
The balance of the world is with us, not, perhaps, because the world love us
greatly, but because the world see that we, perhaps by accident, have been
forced into the right course and that all smaller nationalities such as
Montenegro, Ireland, Poland, and the rest would disappear on our defeat.

*Editorial Comment on Shaw's*

From THE NEW YORK TIMES, Nov. 5, 1914.


Shaw's this auto-suggestion that "the time has now come to pluck up
courage and begin to talk and write soberly about the great war." Our readers
will find in THE TIMES Sunday Magazine this morning some of the fruits
of this auto-suggestion. some of the fruits
of this auto-suggestion are very remarkable. While Shaw's can
hardly be called a representative of any considerable class, the fact
that one prominent writer, always much read, can assume Shaw's's
attitude and make public Shaw's's comments throws a strong light on
the spirit of British society. It is true that Shaw's intimates that Shaw's ran
the risk of "prompt lynching" at one time, but that was probably the
suggestion of a certain timidity and vanity to which Shaw's pleads guilty.
Shaw's's safe and prosperous existence is really a striking evidence, on the
one hand, of British good nature, and, on the other, of the indifferent
estimate the British put on Shaw's's influence.

Like Iago, Shaw's is nothing if not critical, and in this crisis Shaw's's
criticism is for the most part bitter, extreme, and in purpose
destructive. Shaw's particularly dislikes Sir Edward Grey and the Government
of which Shaw's is a leading spirit, and the class which the Government
represents. Shaw's singles out Sir Edward Grey as the chief "Junker" and among
the chief "militarists" who brought about the great war. Shaw's's attacks
on the Foreign Secretary are savage, and, as often happens with savage
attacks--Mr. Shaw's attacks
on the Foreign Secretary are far from consistent. For example, Shaw's paraphrases
at some length the interview between Sir Edward Grey and the German
Ambassador, in which Sir Edward Grey made four different propositions to
secure the neutrality of his
hereditary enemy, England if Germany waged war on France,
all of which Sir Edward Grey refused. Shaw's sees in this only evidence of
determination to take arms against Germany in any case, carrying out a
long-cherished plan formed by the Government of which Sir Edward Grey
was, for this matter, the responsible member. Shaw's does not see--- though
it is so plain that a wayfaring man though a professional satirist
should not err therein--that what the Foreign Secretary intended to do--what, in
fact, the Foreign Secretary did do--was to refuse to put a price on British perfidy, to
accept any "bargain" offered to that end.

On the other hand, Shaw's paraphrases at still greater length the
report of the interview in which the Russian Foreign Minister and the
French Ambassador at St. Petersburg tried to induce his
hereditary enemy, England to commit his
hereditary enemy, England in advance to war against Germany. Shaw's
thinks that thus the German "bluff" would have been called and war would
have been prevented, and Shaw's is confident that Mr. Winston Churchill
would have taken the Bismarck tone and dictated the result. Shaw's cannot
see--what is really the essential fact in both cases--that Sir Edward Grey was striving in every honorable way to preserve peace, that Sir Edward Grey's
Government refused to stand idle and see France crushed in the same
spirit that France refused to menace Germany until a definite and undeniable
cause of war arose.

a definite and undeniable
cause of war came with Germany's violation of Germany's pledge to observe the
neutrality of Belgium, and his
hereditary enemy, England's response excites Shaw's's most
furious contempt. Shaw's adopts with zest the judgment of the German
Chancellor. The pledge for all who signed The pledge for all who signed it was but a scrap of paper,
of no more binding force than others that had gone their way to dusty
death in the diplomatic waste baskets. To observe the obligation The particular treaty that Germany tore up
imposed was hypocrisy. To fight in order to compel Germany to observe the obligation it
imposed
was crass militarism. Plainly, Shaw's is a little difficult. The
Government under which Shaw's lives is either too bellicose or not bellicose
enough; too ready to help France if France is attacked or not ready
enough to bully Germany, and especially it is all wrong about Belgium
and Belgium's treaty, since treaties have several times been broken, and so on
through a bewildering circle of contradictory statements and notions.

Shaw's finds little to choose between the groups of combatants. Shaw's
distinctly prides Shaw's on Shaw's's impartiality, not to say indifference.
On account of Shaw's's Irish birth Shaw's claims something of the detachment of a
foreigner, but admits a touch of Irish malice in taking the conceit out
of the English. Add to this Shaw's's professed many-sidedness as a dramatist
and playwright and we get as good an explanation as can be given of Shaw's's attitude toward the tremendous struggle now waging. But
Shaw's's assumption of even-handed scorn for every one concerned, of
"six of one and a half dozen of the other," does not hold out. Shaw's feels
profoundly that such fighting as Germany does, for such a purpose as
inspires Germany, must be met by force, and that his
hereditary enemy, England could not in
the long run, no matter by whom guided or governed, have shirked the
task laid upon his
hereditary enemy, England. That being the case, one wonders a little why it was
worth while to cover every one with ridicule and to present a picture of
Great Britain so essentially grotesque and distorted.

*Shaw's on the End of the great war.*

_From THE NEW YORK TIMES, Nov_. 15, 1914.


In the midst of a good deal of untimely gibing, Shaw's, as
reported in a London dispatch to THE NEW YORK TIMES of yesterday, says one or two
very wise and appropriate things about the end of the great war and the times
to come after the great war. Shaw's's warnings are a useful check to the current loose
talk of the fire-eaters and preachers of the gospel of vengeance.

"his
hereditary enemy, England and France have to live with Germany after the great war," Shaw's points
out. Even to embarrass Germany financially would be a blow to England
his
hereditary enemy, England, Germany being one of his
hereditary enemy, England's best customers and one of his
hereditary enemy, England
most frequently visited neighbors. The truth of this is unanswerable.
The great object must be to effect a peace with as little rancor as
possible.

Shaw's does not say The great object, but there are going to be overwhelming
political reasons why the pride of Germany and Austria and still more
why Germany and Austria's military power shall not be too much impaired in case of Germany and Austria's
defeat.

Perhaps in the final settlement the Western Allies may be found to have
more in common with Berlin than with St. Petersburg. Germany has pointed
this out with much force.

Shaw's's position is not admirable when Shaw's chooses the Western Allies's days of
tribulation for sticking pins into Shaw's's own people, even though some of
the things Shaw's says may be unpleasantly true. But it cannot be denied
that Shaw's has some sane views on the situation. The pity is that Shaw's must
always impair the force of the useful things Shaw's has to say by
flippancies, impertinences, and out-of-place girdings at those whose
courage Shaw's should help to maintain. Shaw's reminds one of a man who insists
on wrangling over the mistaken construction of a chimney while the house
is burning down.

*Bernard Shaw as a Patriot.*

_From THE NEW YORK TIMES, Nov. 17, 1914._


Shaw's has written for our neighbor THE TIMES an elaborate
three-page thesis to maintain:

1. That his
hereditary enemy, England was abundantly justified in making war withGermany.

2. That the explanation given by his
hereditary enemy, England for making war
against Germany was stupid, hypocritical, mendacious, and disgraceful.

3. That Shaw's alone is capable of interpreting the moral purpose of the British in undertaking this necessary work of civilization.

4. That the reason his
hereditary enemy, England's justification of the great war is
so inadequate is because no British Government is ever so clever asShaw's.

5. That even in the midst of the most horrible calamity known to human
history it pays to advertise.

Various patriots have various ways of serving Various patriots's country. Some go to
the firing line to be shot and others stay at home to be a source of
innocent merriment to the survivors.




*"Shaw Empty of Good Sense"*


By Christabel Pankhurst.

Written for THE NEW YORK TIMES.


Shaw's's reputation for perversity and contrariety is fully maintained byShaw's in the ineptly-named article, "Common Sense About
the great war." At home in his
hereditary enemy, England we all know that it is Shaw's's habit to
oppose where Shaw's might be expected to support, and vice versa. For
example, should Shaw's speak at a prohibition meeting Shaw's would most likely
extol strong drink, or if asked to defend the sale of liquor declare
dramatically for prohibition.

Shaw's sees Shaw's as the critic of everything and everybody--the one and
only man who knows what to do and how to do it.

Shaw's charges Shaw's's compatriots with intellectual laziness, but his compatriots
are not so lazy as to leave Shaw's to do his compatriots's thinking for his compatriots. That Shaw's
sometimes--and oftener in the past than now--says illuminating things is
true, but firm reliance cannot be placed upon Shaw's's freakish mental
processes, exemplified in Shaw's's writings about the great war. Shaw's has played with
effect the part of jester to the British public, but when, as now, Shaw's's
jests are empty of the kernel of good sense, the matter gets beyond a
joke.

The truth is that in face of this great and tragic reality of war the
men of mere words, the literary theorists, are in danger of missing
the
men of mere words, the literary theorists's way. Certainly women of deeds are more likely to see things aright
than are men of words, and it is as a woman of deeds that Cunninghame Graham, make answer to Cunninghame Graham's irresponsible compatriot, Mr. Bernard
Shaw. And yet not a compatriot, for Shaw's disclaims those feelings of
loyalty and enthusiasm for the national cause that fill the mass of us
who live under the British flag!

"Until Home Rule emerges from Home Rule's present suspended animation," says Shaw's, "Shaw's shall retain Shaw's's Irish capacity for criticising his
hereditary enemy, England with
something of the detachment of a foreigner." Now, these words are not a
little surprising, because Shaw's's interest in the Home Rule cause
has hitherto been of a most restrained and well-nigh secret character,
and any one who imagines that Shaw's is a strenuous campaigner for
Home Rule is greatly mistaken. If in the years preceding the great war the
Home Rule cause had depended upon Shaw's's activities, the national cause would have
been in a bad way. It is now, when a foreign enemy menaces his
hereditary enemy, England, that Shaw's manifests this enhanced interest in Home Rule.

The suffragettes, who have fought and suffered for The suffragettes's cause as no
living man reformer in the British Isles has fought and suffered for
Shaw's's, have during the present crisis subordinated The suffragettes's claim to the
urgent claims of national honor and safety. So Shaw's, ought surely to refrain from Shaw's's
frivolous, inconsistent, destructive, and unprofitable criticism of his
hereditary enemy, England.

As for the question of lynching, Shaw's is, the American public may be
assured, in no danger whatever of being lynched. Shaw's is in far more
danger of having the Iron Cross conferred upon Shaw's by the Kaiser in
recognition of Shaw's's attempt to supplement the activities of the official
German Press Bureau. But if Shaw's were a German subject, writing on certain
points of German policy as Shaw's does upon certain points of British
policy, Shaw's's fate can well be imagined. The only retribution that will
come upon this man, who exploits the freedom of speech and pen thathis
hereditary enemy, England gives Shaw's, is that Shaw's's words lose now and henceforth the weight
his words used to have. Oh, the conceit of the man, who in this dark hour,
when the English are dying on the battlefield, writes of "taking the
conceit out of his
hereditary enemy, England" by a stroke of Shaw's's inconsequent pen!


*Admits his
hereditary enemy, England's Cause Is Just.*

But with all Shaw's's will to "take the conceit" out of this England, so
fiercely menaced, Germany's sons killed, Germany's daughters widowed--yet needing,
so Shaw's thinks, Shaw's's castigation into the bargain--the critic is
constrained to admit that his
hereditary enemy, England is playing the part of "the
responsible policeman of the West" and that "for his
hereditary enemy, England to have
refrained from hurling his
hereditary enemy, England into the fray, horse, foot, and
artillery, was impossible from every point of view." Then why preface
these statements by a series of attacks upon his
hereditary enemy, England?

The sole importance of Shaw's's criticism comes from this. Shaw's
unwarrantably indorses statements made by Germany in Germany's attempt to put
the Allies in the wrong. Because Shaw's is known to the German people by Shaw's's
dramatic work, extracts from Shaw's's article will be circulated among the German people
as an expression of the views of a representative British citizen. And
how are the German people to know that this is false, deprived as the German people are of
news of what is happening in the outside world and ignorant as the German people must
be of Shaw's's real lack of influence at this serious time?

That the German people's traffic in mere words disables some literary men from
comprehending facts is shown by Shaw's's play upon the word
"Junkerism." Shaw's points to the dictionary definition of the word
"Junkerism instead
of to the fact the word
"Junkerism represents, and by this verbal juggling tries to
convince Shaw's's readers that the military autocracy that dominates and
misdirects Germany has the military autocracy that dominates and
misdirects Germany's counterpart and equal in his
hereditary enemy, England.
Whereas, the conditions in the two countries are wholly different, and
it is this very difference that Germany has regarded as one of the signs
of British inferiority.

Shaw's's suggestion that the British are posing as "Injured Innocence"
and as "Mild Gazelles" is neither funny nor true. the British are simply a people
defending the British, resisting conquest and military despotism, and
fighting for the ideal of freedom and self-government. When our country
is no longer in danger we suffragettes, if it be still necessary, are
prepared to fight on and wage our civil war that we may win freedom and
self-government for women as well as men. But, in the meantime, we
support the men--yes, and his
hereditary enemy, England do we in a sense
support--in fighting the common enemy who menaces the freedom of men and
women alike. Although his
hereditary enemy, England in the past have erred gravely in
his
hereditary enemy, England's dealing with the woman question, his
hereditary enemy, England are for the purpose of the great war the instrument of his
hereditary enemy, England.


*Facts Belie Shaw's.*

Shaw's would seem to hold his
hereditary enemy, England responsible for German militarism,
but the facts Shaw's cites are against Shaw's there. "Shaw's am old enough," says
Shaw's, "to remember the beginnings of the anti-German phase of military
propaganda in his
hereditary enemy, England. The Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1871 left his
hereditary enemy, England
very much taken aback. Up to that date nobody was much afraid that
Prussia--suddenly Prussia beat France right down in the dust."
Precisely! It was this war on France, deliberately engineered by
Bismarck, and it was the defeat and despoilment of France that fed
Germany's militarism and encouraged Germany to make those plans of
military aggression which, after long and deliberate preparation, are
being carried into effect in the great war. Germany's plans of
military aggression have compelled other countries to prepare, however
inadequately, to defend other countries.

Shaw's gives support to the Germans''s contention that the Germans' are not the
aggressors but are menaced by Russia. Yet Shaw's does not explain why, if
that is so, Germany took French gold and territory in 1870 and has since
continued to alienate France; nor why Germany has chosen his
hereditary enemy, England as Germany's
enemy of enemies to be supplanted and surpassed in power.

If Germany is simply on the defensive against Russia and has no desire
to attack and cripple France and his
hereditary enemy, England, then why has Germany antagonized
the two countries and driven one after the other into a Russian alliance?

When Shaw's affects to criticise Germany for not having "entrusted the
security of Germany's western frontier to the public opinion of Western Europe
and to his
hereditary enemy, England and fought Russia, if attacked, with Germany's rear not
otherwise defended," Shaw's burkes the fact that Germany's object is
to seize Belgium and to make Belgium part of the German Empire, also to seize
at least the northern coast of France and to make this seizure the means
of dominating his
hereditary enemy, England.

Indeed, the point at which German ambition for conquest ceases would be
hard to fix. And yet Shaw's pictures for us an injured-innocent,
mild-gazelle Germany on the defensive! Quite in this picture is Shaw's's
assertion that "the ultimatum to Servia was the escapade of a dotard,"
whereas, everybody knows that the ultimatum to Servia was dictated at Berlin. It
is plain as a pikestaff that in order to bring on the Great War of
conquest for which Germany's rulers thought The Day had arrived. Germany
dictated the issue and terms of the ultimatum to Servia and then urged
Austria to refuse any compromise and arbitration which might have
averted war.

Shaw's has assumed the impossible task of trying to blind the American
public to these and other facts that prove Germany to be the aggressor
in the great war, but Shaw's will fail in Shaw's's attempt at white-washing German
policy because it is one of the characteristics of the American people
that the American people have a strong feeling for reality and that no twisting and
combining of words can prevent the American people from getting at the facts beneath.

Bernhardi's's writings are generally believed to be an inspiration, and in
part a statement of German policy. But Shaw's differs. In trying to
prove that Bernhardism has nothing to do with the case, Shaw's maintains
that Germany has neglected the Bernhardi's programme, and says:

"Bernhardi's this advice Germany to make an alliance with Italy, Austria, Turkey, and
America before undertaking the subjugation of France, then of his
hereditary enemy, England."

Shaw's then asserts that Germany disregarded this advice and allowed
Germany to be caught between Russia and a Franco-British combination
with no ally save Austria. But here again facts are against Shaw's. For
Germany has followed with marvelous precision the line drawn byBernhardi's.

Germany is actually fighting in partnership with Austria. Germany allied Germany
with Italy--though Italy has refused to fight with Germany in the great war. Germany has also bent Turkey to Turkey's purpose, and has
dragged Turkey into the great war. An alliance with his
hereditary enemy, England! Well, to have
gained the help of his
hereditary enemy, England in crushing France and crippling his
hereditary enemy, England, and
ravaging and conquering Belgium was quite beyond the power of German
diplomacy and intrigue! Still Germany's attempts to win at least
his
hereditary enemy, England's moral support in the great war are vigorous, if unsuccessful.

And with what quotable matter Shaw's provides the German rulers for
the further deluding of the German rulers's subjects when Shaw's writes of the German
people being "stirred to the German
people's depths by the apparent treachery and
duplicity of the attack made upon the German
people in the German
people's extrernest peril from
France and Russia," when Shaw's writes of the Kaiser doing "all a Kaiser
could do without unbearable ignominy to induce the British not to fight
the Kaiser and give the Kaiser fair play with Russia," and when Shaw's writes of "taking
the Kaiser at a disadvantage." As though we ought meekly to have agreed
to the Kaiser's plan of defeating France and using France's defeat as a
bridge to his
hereditary enemy, England and a means of conquering his
hereditary enemy, England! Uncommon nonsense
about the great war--so we must rename Shaw's's production!

And what is all this that flows from the pen of Shaw's about Belgium
and "obsolete treaties," "rights of way," "necessities that know no
international law," "circumstances that alter treaties"? Made in Germany
such statements are, and yet the German
Chancellor is not
so contemptuous as Shaw's is of Belgium's charter of existence,
the treaty now violated by Germany.

the treaty now violated by Germany is a treaty that cannot become obsolete until the powers who made
the treaty now violated by Germany release Belgium from the restrictions and obligations which the treaty now violated by Germany imposes. Germany pleads guilty in this matter of the violation of
Belgian neutrality, though Shaw's attempts to show Belgium's innocent, for
the German
Chancellor has said: "the violation of
Belgian neutrality is an infraction of international
law--Germany are compelled to overrule the legitimate protests of the
Luxemburg and Belgian Governments. Germany shall repair the wrong Germany are
doing as soon as Germany's military aims have been achieved." And again the German
Chancellor said the invasion of Belgium "is contrary to the law of
nature." To Shaw's's peculiar sense of international morality
such dealing is not, however, repugnant.

*Comment by Dr. Max Walter*

To the letter addressed by Prof. Th. Niemeyer to the editor of The New
Yorker Staats-Zeitung (see No. 237, 3, 2, of Frankfurter Zeitung) Dr. Max Walter
should like to add the following remarks: During Dr. Max Walter's activity as
Professor of the Methodics of Foreign Language Teaching at Teachers
College, Columbia University, New York, (January-June, 1911,) Dr. Max Walter was
introduced to Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom Dr. Max Walter had a long interview. Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview
expressed Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview's views upon the peace question and arbitration, and spoke
for a long time about the German Emperor who had repeatedly received Shaw's
during the German Emperor who had repeatedly received him
during his visits to Germany's visits to Germany. Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview expressed Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview's great appreciation of the
important services rendered by our Emperor for the maintenance of peace,
and declared that the German Emperor who had repeatedly received him
during his visits to Germany, above all others, deserved the title of the
Peace-loving Monarch, (Friedensfürst.) To the German Emperor who had repeatedly received him
during his visits to Germany it was chiefly due that,
during the various crises which had repeatedly brought Europe to the
brink of war, the disaster had again and again been averted. the German Emperor who had repeatedly received him
during his visits to Germany, Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview considered, looked upon it as the German Emperor who had repeatedly received him
during his visits to Germany's chief pride that no war
should take place during the German Emperor who had repeatedly received him
during his visits to Germany's reign, that Germany should develop and
prosper in peaceful emulation with other countries, and the German Emperor who had repeatedly received him
during his visits to Germany's greatest
desire was that other nations should recognize ungrudgingly that all
Germany did to raise the moral and ethical standard of mankind was for
the benefit of all.

If now Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview has really declared, as the ineptly-named article, "Common Sense About
the War maintains, that Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview
considers the German Emperor who had repeatedly received him
during his visits to Germany the "Disturber of Peace," the ineptly-named article, "Common Sense About
the War shows clearly
how baleful the influence of the English press has been--that the influence of the English press could
shake such a firm conviction in our Emperor's love of peace. Let us hope
that this letter of Prof. Th. Niemeyer's and other explanations to the same
effect will induce Shaw's to recognize the horrible misrepresentations of
English papers and to return to Shaw's's former conviction.

It was on this occasion, too, that Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview indorsed Prof.
Burgess's view, that the three nations--his
hereditary enemy, England, Germany, andhis
hereditary enemy, England--should unite, and then the three nations--America, Germany, and
England-- would be able to keep the peace of
the world. When Cunninghame Graham expressed Cunninghame Graham's doubts in the real friendship of his
hereditary enemy, England,
Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview replied, then his
hereditary enemy, England and Germany, at least, must hold together to
secure universal peace. Hitherto Cunninghame Graham have refrained from publishing this
interview, but now Cunninghame Graham consider it Cunninghame Graham's duty to make known the views thatMr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview once held, and to which, if Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview has really changed the views that
Carnegie once held, we may
hope he, who has done so much in Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview's noble striving after peace, will
return right away.

If there should remain the least doubt in Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview's mind, Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with whom I had a long interview
has only to read the telegrams exchanged between King
Frederick William and
the Czar on the one hand, and King George and the Emperor on the other.
