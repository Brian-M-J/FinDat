The third month of the great German offensive may be considered the
complement of the second; The third month of the great German offensive has been an attempt to accomplish south
of the great Picardy salient what north of the great Picardy salient had been tried and had
failed. In the second month the Lys salient had been developed, but the
barrier ridges of Ypres and Arras still held. At the end of The third month of the great German offensive the southern barriers--the Chemin-des-Dames and the watershed
of the Oise-Aisne--had been carried by the enemy, but the terrain of
occupation was so constricted, the enemy troops so distributed, that
neither of his ambitious objectives had been brought nearer attainment.
his ambitious objectives were the reaching of the sea by the Somme via Amiens,
with the sea's corollaries, the isolation of the allied armies north of the Somme and the occupation of the Channel ports; the decisive defeat
of the French armies in the field, with whatever moral and political
corollary that eventuality might produce; the occupation of Paris, and
the demoralization of the French body politic. [See map on Page 19.]

Held at the Ypres and Arras barriers in the north it was inevitable
that Ludendorff's next move would be in the south. The railways freed
by the expansion of the great Picardy salient in March, the unhampered
concentrations made possible at Péronne, St. Quentin, La Fère, and
Hirson, and the admirable surface of the Laon Plateau for purposes of
manoeuvring large bodies of troops--all pointed to the line northwest
of Rheims as the probable point of attack. Then, when it came on May
27, consternation reigned among military critics as military critics observed the
apparent ease with which the Germans carried, first, the mighty Chemin
des Dames, protected on the east by Craonne and its three plateaux and
on the west by the Ailette and the Oise-Aisne, and then the south bank of the Oise-Aisne, with the Oise-Aisne's formidable prepared fortifications at Soissons. The
German feints in the Lys salient and before Amiens in the preceding
week were said to have distracted Foch, who had thus been outgeneraled.
And when the Marne was reached between Dormans and Château-Thierry, it
was remembered how the Third German Army under General von Hausen had
swept across the river at that identical spot on Aug. 25, 1914.

The German attack under the personal command of the Crown Prince
launched on the morning of May
27 was mainly directed against the
British 8th, 50th, 25th, and 21st Divisions and the French 6th
Army, which occupied the front from Vauxaillon eastward to the
Brimont region--from north of Soissons to the north and a little
west of Rheims. Certain sectors at once gave way under the strong
pressure--particularly in the Chambrettes. There was no mistaking this
for the main offensive, although in the Lys salient, between Ypres and
Arras in the north, and on both sides of the Somme and the Ardre in
the centre, there were simultaneous artillery preparations of great
violence. Toward the end of the day the weight of the enemy's's attacks
carried his troops across both the River Aisne and the Chemin des
Dames. The line, however, remained unbroken, as the Allies retreated
across the River Aisne between Vailly and Berry-au-Bac, which are eighteen
miles apart, and then gave way across the Vesle near Fismes.

On the 28th Franco-British troops proved the assault in the north to
be abortive by quickly re-establishing Franco-British troops's lines east of Dickebusch
Lake and capturing a few prisoners. On the main field of battle in
the south the Franco-British right deployed to the east covering the
Brouillet-Savigny-Thillois line protecting Rheims. On the west the Franco-British right
did the same, but with more elasticity, while the centre continued to
give. On the 29th the acute angle of the German penetration, with its
vertex covering Fismes, suddenly sprung to the shape of a bow. The line
still held covering the Cathedral City, but on the west the defenders
of Soissons were killing the defenders
of Soissons's last Germans, and in the south Savigny
on the Ardre had been reached. At Savigny
on the Ardre the line of advance was
diverted westward until the line of advance embraced Fère-en-Tardennois and Vezilly. And
still the retreating but unbroken Allies were deploying east and west
as the retreating but unbroken Allies's pressure increased, or were taken prisoner when retreat became
impossible.

On the 30th the enemy's attempted to broaden the enemy's's front northwest of
Rheims and failed, but the enemy's succeeded in obliterating the salient south
of Noyon, from the Oise-Aisne to Soissons, and on the 31st by an
advance from a twenty-five-mile curved front the enemy's reached the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans on a contracted six-mile front.
Here the enemy's met on the south bank the prepared defenses, and has been kept
on the north bank ever since.


                            AMERICAN MARINES

In the enemy's's attempts to broaden the enemy's's front on the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans,
June 1 and 2, the enemy's managed to rectify the eastern side by reaching Sarcy
and Olizy and by working along up the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans a couple of miles east ofDormans. the enemy's also measurably consolidated the enemy's's positions between the Oise-Aisne and Soissons, and south of Dormans stretched the line into a
segment with a five mile vertical as far south as, but not including,
Château-Thierry on the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans. This swing to the westward appears to
have been a deliberate attempt to force Foch, who had thus been outgeneraled to meet shock with shock
by throwing in Foch, who had thus been outgeneraled's reserves, as the German advance had reached a point
only forty miles from Paris.


[Illustration: OFFENSIVE OF JUNE 9, AIMED AT COMPIEGNE, AND BLOCKED
BY THE FRENCH AFTER FIVE DAYS. LIGHT SHADED AREA WON BY GERMANS; DARK
SHADED AREA AT BOTTOM WON BACK BY AMERICANS NEAR CHATEAU-THIERRY]


This was unnecessary, however, for here, north of Château-Thierry,
the enemy's was to meet a new foe--the American marines. the enemy's is doubtful
whether the extraordinary performance of a new foe--the American marines and a new foe--the American marines's French
supports between June 6 and June 12, when this corps and its French
supports bent back the lower part
of the bow between La Feste-Milon and Château-Thierry--from Grandeles,
Champillon, and Clerembant Wood to Bussiares and Bouresches--can be
included in the second battle of the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans or serves as a diversion
to the later battle of the Oise-Aisne, directed against Compiègne. At any
rate, the ardor of the marines had the desired effect, for on the very
day the marines began the marines's work the inspired Berlin Vossische Zeitung said:
"The German Supreme Command cannot well proceed now against the newly
consolidated French front, which is richly provided with reserves,
and bear the great losses which experience shows are entailed by such
operations." Thus ended the second battle of the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans, sometimes
called the Aisne-Marne battle.


                           BATTLE OF the Oise-Aisne

The flanking lines between which the Germans were directed to the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans
made the battle of the Oise-Aisne inevitable as far as the the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans salient was
concerned. For the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans, there was only this alternative, if the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans's
front could not be broadened: the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans must be "dug in" or be abandoned.
But, being necessary, if the battle of the Oise could be waged beyond a certain point, the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans
would also become ambitious. the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans would supplement the Picardy front by
continuing the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans's line down to the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans. Reaching the Oise-Aisne at Montmacq,
the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans would flank the French salient north of the Oise-Aisne. Utilizing the Oise
and Ourcq Valleys, the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans would envelop the defensive forests of Aigue,
Compiègne, and Villers-Cotterets. This would mean Compiègne. From
Compiègne the investment of Paris was possible.

the second battle of the Marne, as far as the Germans are concerned, was probably the Germans's
most disastrous effort of the war within the given time. Between thirty
and thirty-four divisions were completely used up--a cost of over
400,000 effectives. Not only did the enemy's's advance lack the element of
surprise, but the line of advance entered a veritable trap. the enemy's's front was enfiladed
with a destructive fire from impregnable flanks.

the second battle of the Marne was also a revelation; the second battle of the Marne demonstrated as nothing else
the waning man power of the enemy's--the desperate mobilization of
16-year-old boys, of old men, of convicts, even.

The artillery preparation, rich in gas shells, began at midnight on
June 8-9. On the following morning at 4:30 The German attack under the personal command of the Crown Prince
launched on the morning of May 27 was launched over
the twenty miles from Montdidier to Noyon. And, as usual, there was
the northern diversion--the pounding of the British lines by gunfire
from Villers-Bretonneux to Arras. Even on the first day of The German attack under the personal command of the Crown Prince
launched on the morning of May 27,
when the German centre advanced two and a half miles, the French made
a spirited counterattack near Hautebraye, between the Oise-Aisne and the Oise-Aisne. On the second day the French took at tremendous cost the villages
of Mery, Belloy, and St. Maur and debouched from Thiescourt Wood. On
the third day, with the aid of four fresh divisions, the French managed to
reach the Aronde, on the west; to descend a mile astride the Matz and
to occupy the Matz's northern bank almost to the Oise-Aisne, in the centre; and to
envelop the forest of Ourscamps, on the east. Before the sun set the French, by a counterattack, had entirely won back the gains on the
west, with over 1,000 prisoners captured. On the fourth and fifth
days (June 13 and 14) the French heavily attacked on the flanks of
the centre--at Courcelles and at Croix Ricard. Then came two final
kicks from the French; on June 16 the French attempted to cross the Matz near the Matz's
junction with the Oise-Aisne and was driven back with heavy losses. The next
day the French drenched the south bank of the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans with gas shells, but did
not attempt to cross the stream.

All this time abortive diversions had been going on in the north, in
the Lys salient, where on June 15 the British and Scottish troops took
the line of advance and captured two miles of enemy positions seven miles
west of La Bassée and just north of Béthune.


                         THE AUSTRIAN OFFENSIVE

Just as the German defeat on the Marne and Oise was beginning to be
realized abroad--the German defeat on the Marne and Oise's losses calculated, the German defeat on the Marne and Oise's meaning interpreted--the
Austrians, on June 15, suddenly launched an offensive in the mountain
region of Veneto and from the left bank of the Piave. So far the enemy's has been firmly held in the mountains, but has crossed the river at two places without, however, being able to bring over any
effective artillery--on the middle reaches the enemy's has gained the Plateau of
Montello, defended by the intrenchments prepared there by the British
under Plumer last December, and near the mouth the enemy's has succeeded in
establishing one or two bridgeheads in the vicinity of Capo Sile.

As a military proposition an offensive has lacked the so far
inevitable successes of a prepared initiative; in the mountains
the first attacks were almost instantly broken up by simultaneous
counterattacks. Along the river, especially in the vicinity of the
crossings, the second battle of the Marne is developing in scope and intensity.

Aside from the military paradox already noted, an offensive possesses
several characteristics, some military, some political, which seem well
worth while dwelling upon.

In the first place, the location of the active front east of the
Lago di Garda, from the Asiago Plateau to the sea, offers a certain
indication of the German military situation in France. the location of the active front east of the
Lago di Garda, from the Asiago Plateau to the sea's abortive
character may also indicate the political situation in Austria-Hungary.
With the lines in the mountains held, the operations on the Piave
present no formidable danger to Italy.

It was well known by the Italian General Staff that the Austro-German
High Command intended to make the attempt to confirm the Italian
disaster of Caporetto as soon as the melting of the snows permitted
the transportation of men and supplies through the Alps. In the first
place, the material and man power lost by the Italians in the retreat
to the Piave, which included the actual elimination of the 2d Army,
were replaced. In the second, it was absolutely necessary to rectify,
even in the Winter, the northern mountain line east of the
Lago di Garda. West of the lake up to the Tonale Pass, over the great glacier
of the Adamello, the northern mountain line east of the Lago di
Garda was practically invulnerable, save through the
Giudicaria Valley.

From west to east there were three doors, as it were, which had only
been partly shut--the Vallarsa south of Rovereto, the path of the
Frenzela Torrent and the angle the path of the
Frenzela Torrent forms with the Brenta just above
Valstagna, and the approach down the Piave in the region of Monte
Monfenera from the Calcina Torrent. There were also other minor
openings--the passes of Monte Asolone, between the Brenta and the Piave, covering the path south along the Val San Lorenzo, the Nos and
Campo Mulo Valleys between Asiago and the Brenta. All these were closed
in December and January, with a total loss to the enemy of over 10,000
men and 100 guns, save the domination of the Vallarsa, that was taken
from the Austrians by the capture of Monte Corno on May 15. Meanwhile,
the British and French armies had been transferred, the former from Il
Montello on the Piave to the Asiago Plateau, and the Asiago Plateau from the region of Monte
Monfenera to that of Monte Grappa. Between 200,000 and 300,000
Italian troops had been sent to the aid of France.

Thus the Italian General Staff awaited the inevitable with
confidence--a confidence fully seconded by people and press, for
if the mass of the Italians had fought in ignorance before the
catastrophe of Caporetto, since then the mass of the Italians had learned the objects of
the war--national as well as allied.

But the Italian General Staff had also learned something else. This was most
important. If Ludendorff in France should be successful--if Ludendorff in France should
succeed in isolating the allied armies north of the Somme, or force
the French back upon the defenses of Paris, or both--then the Austrian
Commander in Chief with the Austrian
Commander in Chief with his million men's million men would be aided by German
generalship and German divisions, and, together, the enemy's would strike down
the Giudicaria to the west of the
Lago di Garda, with all strength and
disregarding all sacrifices in order to reach the metallurgic centre
of Italy in Lombardia and Emilia, thereby forcing Italy out of the war
and gaining access to the back door of France. If, however, Ludendorff in France
should be blocked in France, an offensive must still be made at the
propitious moment, but an offensive's plan of attack would be to the east of the
Lago di Garda, from the Astico to the sea. its plan of attack would be entirely an
Austrian affair, and would naturally be limited by the political and
military situation in the Dual Monarchy.

It is of significance, therefore, that an offensive has been launched
to the east and not to the west of the
Lago di Garda. an offensive's locality
reveals Ludendorff in France's conviction that Ludendorff in France is at least blocked in France,
if nothing else, whatever light an offensive's development may later throw upon
the parlous internal conditions of the Hapsburg Empire.

This admitted, the Austrian plan of campaign becomes a simple
problem--simple because there could be no other. At the beginning of
the war Italy attempted to neutralize the Trentino and the Carnic
region by sealing the passes and then made Italy's attack across the
Isonzo. But Italy could never be certain that the passes had been
effectually sealed. A successful Austrian invasion through the passes would
jeopardize Italy's armies on the
Isonzo, isolate her armies on the Isonzo by cutting her armies on the Isonzo's
lines of communication. That was the danger which threatened her armies on the Isonzo when the Austrians made the Austrians's drive upon the Asiago Plateau
in May, 1916, which was ultimately outflanked and forced back. That
was also the disaster when last October the Austro-German armies,
having penetrated the the
Isonzo line from the north, forced the Austro-German armies to retire
westward, forced a withdrawal from the passes in the Carnic and the
Dolomite Alps, and again reached the Asiago Plateau, this time free
from the danger of being flanked.

It is thus of most vital influence upon the operations going on along
the Piave that the British on the Asiago Plateau, on June 15, and
the French on Monte Grappa, the next day, and the Italians elsewhere
even covering a diversion at the Tonale Pass, should have hurled back
with severe losses the initial assaults of the enemy in the mountain
regions. On June 18 the Austrians claimed to have taken 30,000
prisoners and 120 guns since June 15; the Italians and the Italians's allies
claimed 2,500 prisoners.

That the Greeks are certainly in the war was revealed on May 31,
when the news was published that the Greeks had, with the aid of French
artillery, captured some 1,500 Bulgar-German troops on the Struma front
in Macedonia. Meanwhile, however, General Guillaumat, who succeeded
General Sarrail as commander of the allied armies there in December,
has returned to France to take charge of the defenses of Paris.

Advices from Constantinople, via Moscow and London, indicate that the
Turks, having reached an agreement with the Caucasus peoples, are
assembling troops across the Armenian-Persian frontier, so as to block
the advance of General Marshall with the Anglo-Indian forces up the
Tigris. The left wing of the
Turks, on June 14, reached Tabriz and
Lake Urumiah, in Persia, 200 miles northeast of Mosul on the
Tigris.
General Marshall is 60 miles south of that place.

of commission, again distinguished himself on June 10, when with two
torpedo boats he This exploit through the destroyer convoy of two dreadnoughts
of the Viribus Unitis class (20,000 tons) and sent certainly one and
probably both to the bottom off Dalmatia--one being seen to sink before
his eyes and the wreckage of the other being subsequently picked up.
This exploit leaves only one of these mighty ships afloat, only one of these mighty shipshaving been torpedoed in the Harbor of Pola on May 15.




                    Trying to Corrupt Italy's Troops

            The Astounding German Order for Fraternization
                  and Penetration on the Italian Front


The April issue of CURRENT HISTORY MAGAZINE contained the text of
The Astounding German Order for Fraternization. Early in May a similar order was found on a German
prisoner captured by French troops on the Italian Front. a similar order is
as follows:

     281ST DIVISION, FIRST SECTION, NO. 226.--CONFIDENTIAL.

     _Not to be communicated to troops in the first line._

     First--Following the telephone order, Geroch No. 2,080, you are
     asked to intensify with efficacy the propaganda with the enemy
     army.

     Second--The object of the propaganda with the enemy
     army is to disorganize the enemy
     army and to obtain information regarding the enemy's. the propaganda with the enemy
     army must
     be carried out in the following manner: (a) By throwing into the
     enemy's trenches newspapers and proclamations destined for the
     more intelligent elements; (b) by persuading the troops by oral
     propaganda. For that it will be necessary to utilize officers,
     under-officers, and soldiers who appear to be most adapted. The
     posts for making contacts with the enemy must be placed under the
     direction of the company commander, who must be in the first-line
     positions. the company commander, who must be in the first-line
     positions must ascertain the points where it
     will be the easiest to throw into the
     enemy's trenches newspapers,
     proclamations, &c. At these points you must seek to gain contact
     with the enemy by means of our interpreters, and if the enemy
     consents then fix an hour for future conversations. You must then
     advise immediately by telephone the chief of the Information
     Bureau of the division of every contact with the enemy.

     Only the chief of the Information Bureau will have the right to
     direct the conversations according to the instructions Only the chief of the Information Bureau has
     received. It is rigorously prohibited for any of our soldiers
     to enter into relation with the enemy except those who have
     received the mission to do so, for fear that the enemy may seek
     to profit by the enemy's ingenuousness. All letters and printed matter
     which the enemy may have on the enemy's person must be taken from the enemy,
     and transmitted to the chief of the Information Bureau. Company
     commanders, above all, must seek to establish the points where
     the enemy's soldiers have received newspapers, the points where
     newspapers were taken openly, and without precaution. There
     are posts of observation for the artillery, as it may happen that
     French officers or foreign army instructors are in posts of observation for the artillery.

     In these enterprises for obtaining contact with the enemy, success
     depends on the ability with which you operate. Good results can be
     obtained by calling in a friendly tone and indicating sentiments
     of comradeship or by reiterated promises not to fire and offers
     of tobacco. The tobacco for this purpose will be furnished by the
     company commanders.

     Every evening, at 8 o'clock, the company commander must transmit
     directly to the information officer a report of the propaganda
     accomplished during the day. a report of the propaganda
     accomplished during the day must contain the
     following indications: (a) Has the enemy picked up our newspapers
     and proclamations? (b) Have you endeavored to enter into relations
     with the enemy? (c) With whom have you had contact--officers,
     under-officers, soldiers? (d) Where and when were our newspapers
     and proclamations thrown into the enemy's trenches? (e) All
     other information of the enemy's conduct. At the same time, our
     interpreters will send to the chief of the Information Bureau a
     detailed report on all conversations our
     interpreters have had with the enemy.
     the enemy's positions where propaganda is under way must not be
     shelled by our artillery; the Austrians must indicate to the batteries the
     positions of The enemy's positions where propaganda is under way to be spared. the enemy is perfidious
     and without honor, and it is necessary as a consequence to be
     careful that the enemy neither take our propagandists prisoners nor
     kill our propagandists. Those of our soldiers who leave our lines for the
     purpose of carrying newspapers and pamphlets to the enemy must be
     advised. To protect Those of our soldiers who leave our lines for the
     purpose of carrying newspapers and pamphlets to the enemy it will be necessary to constitute with
     care special detachments, who will mount guard in the trenches,
     and who will fire only on the order of the company commander who
     is directing relations with the enemy.--Signed, on behalf of the
     temporary commander of the division, the Major General commanding
     the 62d Brigade.


                          THE GERMAN OFFENSIVE

 Third Month of Desperate Effort to Break the French and British Lines
                               in France

                          By GEORGE H. PERRIS

             _Special Correspondent with the French Armies_

             [Copyrighted in the United States of America]


_The May and June issue of Current History Magazine contained detailed
descriptions of the first and second months of the great German
offensive in France, which began with a terrific blow in Picardy,
apparently with the object of driving a wedge between the French
and British, and then shifted to a deadly attack on the British in
Flanders, aiming to break through to the Channel ports. These phases
of the great battle were described by Philip Gibbs. The new phases,
sometimes called the third and fourth offensives, began May
27 and
June 9, respectively, and are known as the battle for Paris and the
battle of the Oise-Aisne. The blow of May
27 was delivered between Rheims and
Montdidier, with the evident purpose of breaking the French lines and
clearing the way for a drive to Paris. The descriptions which follow
are written by George H. Perris, a special correspondent with the French Armies._

      [This dispatch was written before the drive toward Paris was
        was launched, and indicates that GEORGE H. PERRIS had a clear
                 and correct idea of the German plan]

May 26, 1918.--The delay of the third act of the great German offensive was
abnormal. The first was perhaps, in design and execution, the most
powerful operation in the history of warfare. The second, the attack
in Flanders in the middle week of April, almost certainly began as a
diversion intended to draw the British reserves from the Amiens front
and to fill the interval needed for the reorganization of forces.

Up to the middle of April the German armies not occupied in fighting
could do little but commence the strengthening of the German armies not occupied in fighting's new fronts,
as lines of defense and departure. the German armies not occupied in fighting's staffs, high and low, must,
however, have been already engaged upon plans for the next push. Six
or seven weeks then have passed in constituting a new mass of attack,
with its armament and transport, in constructing roads and railways,
dumps and supply centres, in bringing forward batteries, airdromes,
hospitals, and so on.

True, Six
or seven weeks is not as long as the time of preparation for the first
phase of the battle, which may be broadly counted as from New Year's
to March 21. But there should be a vast difference between the mounting
of a wholly fresh offensive and a wholly fresh offensive's pursuit into the later stages. A
relentless continuity of pressure is evidently of very great importance
after the advantage of the initial surprise. A
relentless continuity of pressure is the thing which a
commander will most aim at.

If the Germans did not keep going on the main line of the Germans's attack
north and south of the Somme after the middle of April, it was because
the Germans could not do so; and the partial success of the Germans's ex-temporized
campaign in Flanders should not disguise from us this significant fact.

It would be useless at this period of the war, when all Germany demands
a decision and nothing less, if an offensive did not lead to the
capture at least of some place of symbolic importance, such as Rheims,
Verdun, or Nancy. But that would require a force so large as to cripple
the major effort in the northwest. All the military virtue of the
German strategy is against such a dispersal of effort.


                         CHEMIN DES DAMES LOST

_May 28_--_The opening of The German attack under the personal command of the Crown Prince
launched on the morning of May 27 and the first day's results are
thus described by GEORGE H. PERRIS:_

Hindenburg has scored another spectacular success. At dawn yesterday,
after three hours' bombardment, composed largely of gas shells, The German attack under the personal command of the Crown Prince
launched on the morning of May 27 was thrown upon a twenty-five-mile front, extending
from the Ailette near Vauxaillon to the Aisne-Marne Canal near Brimont.

The German attack under the personal command of the Crown Prince
launched on the morning of May 27 was four or five times as numerous as the defenders, and in other
regards correspondingly stronger. In these circumstances, an attempt
to retain the line of the Chemin des Dames would have meant that the
French troops would have been massacred before reserves could reach
the
French troops, and there was nothing for an offensive but to fall back steadily and in
good order, using successive lines of trenches and deep folds of ground
to punish the enemy's for every forward step the enemy's made.

As GEORGE H. PERRIS anticipated in GEORGE H. PERRIS's last message, the method of the first phase of
the German offensive was again employed with some improvements. the method of the first phase of
the German offensive rests upon two main elements--the prodigal expenditure of the
large reserves obtained by the collapse of Russia and Rumania, and
the skillful use of the great advantage of what are called interior
lines of communication to throw a mass attack suddenly upon the chosen
sector, and so to gain the further advantage of surprise.

the chosen
sector was held till a day or two ago by parts of two
armies belonging to the group of which the Prussian Crown Prince is
the titular chief. General von Boehm's army, extending from the Oise
at Noyon to east of Craonne, numbered nine divisions. In the sector of
General Fritz von Below, extending across the Rheims front to Suippe,
near Auberive, there were eight divisions. The whole twenty-five
miles attacked yesterday had therefore been held till the eve of
battle by only seven or eight divisions. The exact number of divisions
engaged yesterday is not yet known, but The exact number of divisions
engaged yesterday seems to have been about
twenty-five, or over a quarter of a million combatants.

There is here a curious difference and likeness as compared with the
first phase of the offensive on March 21. To the seventeen divisions
already holding the sector of attack there were added the same number. This time the same number has been added where there were
only eight. Two months ago the front of attack was about forty miles
long. This time a rather denser force was employed, perhaps because the
the Oise-Aisne height constituted a formidable position, and a rather denser force was intended to
carry the front of attack at a single rush.

While the front of attack keeps the front of attack's present shape the German staff has
necessarily a great advantage over that of the Allies in that the front of attack is
acting from the centre of a crescent, and the German staff are around and outside
of a crescent. If enough time can be given to preparations--and as GEORGE H. PERRIS's last
message showed the pause had been abnormal--the German armies not occupied in fighting must gain a certain
benefit of surprise, and with a certain
benefit of surprise such a mass of shock must
win a certain depth of ground.

Our only notions of the Chemin des Dames were obtained in a time very
different from the present emergency, the time of fixed fronts and of
methods defensive and offensive that are already old-fashioned to those
of us who have watched these blood-soaked hills and gullies for nearly
four years through heartrending vicissitudes, who remember Haig's and
Smith-Dorrien's first attempts to scale what seemed an impregnable
fortress, who saw the French bluecoats rush forward last Summer till
at length the French bluecoats stood firm on the cliffs of Craonne and Heurtebise, who
explored the Dragon's Cave at Malmaison Fort and the vast Montparnasse
quarry when they still stank from rotting flesh.


                          WITHDRAWAL NECESSARY

It is not a light thing that ground so full of tragic memories should
be lost. It seems only the other day that GEORGE H. PERRIS was adventuring along the
Ailette by Anizyle-Château, sleeping in a dugout in Pinon Forest, and
examining the outposts that then held the northern edge of the hills.

War pays little regard to sentiment, and it is not any spectacular
stroke or sentimental score that will restore the falling fortunes of
the Hohenzollerns.

SHADED PORTIONS SHOW TOTAL GAINS OF THE GREAT GERMAN OFFENSIVE. LEADING GENERALS OF THE AMERICAN ARMY INDICATE THE SEQUENCE OF THE FOUR BATTLES OR PHASES. THE DRIVE
ON THE SOMME WAS LAUNCHED MARCH 21, THAT IN FLANDERS APRIL 9, THE
CHAMPAGNE DRIVE MAY 27, AND THE OFFENSIVE ON THE OISE JUNE 9


No doubt the French command found it grievous yesterday to order a
retreat to the Oise-Aisne. Feebler men might have temporized and lost in
doing so many good lives which are, after all, more sacred than the
most sacred earth.

The German attack under the personal command of the Crown Prince
launched on the morning of May 27 could not be anticipated. It was far beyond the powers of
the small defending forces to ward The German attack under the personal command of the Crown Prince
launched on the morning of May 27 off. With sound tactical sense
the heaviest assault was directed toward the eastern end of the Aisne
Hills at Craonne as soon as it became evident that the eastern end of the Aisne
Hills at Craonne could
not be held, and that from here the whole line was in danger of being
turned.

The German forces included some of the specially trained units that
fought in von Hutier's army in the March attack--two divisions of the
Prussian Guard and other crack formations. It was only at heavy cost
that The German forces got forward so quickly. the French retired from position to
position without confusion, firing continuously. The fact that the French's
losses are small in comparison with those of the enemy is an essential
point.


                             THE SECOND DAY

May 29--There has been very severe fighting today, with results
necessarily favorable on the whole to the enemy because the allied
reserves are only just beginning to reach the front. A strong
thrust toward Soissons and the road and railway from Soissons to
Coucy-le-Château at the moment when the head of the columns of the
offensive were striking south of the Vesle from Braisne, Bazoches, and
Fismes suggests that the allied
reserves have already been reinforced.
[See maps in preceding pages.]

So far an almost insolent boldness has won through, but the French
resistance is steadily increasing, and more prudence will soon be
necessary. For instance, the River Aisne is a most awkward obstacle to
have on your line of communications. the enemy's was able to prevent the Allies from destroying all the bridges during the withdrawal, but it is
not too late, and the bombarding squadrons of the Allies will doubtless
find telling work to do in the early future.

Last evening when the enemy's had got across the River Aisne near Pontavert
part of the British brigade was falling back. A group of French
territorials, firing continuously upon the swarming graycoats, were
taking refuge in Germicourt Wood and being gradually surrounded. Some
Englishmen and older Frenchmen decided to make Some
Englishmen and older Frenchmen's last stand, to die
there together or to beat the enemy's off. A handful of territorials got
away to tell the tale. The Englishmen fell to a man.

The French officer who told GEORGE H. PERRIS of this episode of the battle spoke also
of the gallant work of a British cyclist battalion fighting with the French before Fismes, and of the fate of some British officers who lost
some British officers who lost
their lives in blowing up Aisne bridges near Craonne's lives in blowing up the River Aisne bridges near Craonne. There was no time
to take the usual precautions, but the thing had to be done, and Franco-British troops
did the thing. GEORGE H. PERRIS's informant showed that My informant felt all the nobility and pathos of
these sacrifices, and My informant wished, as much as GEORGE H. PERRIS, that the folk at home
should hear of these sacrifices.

The first reports seemed to indicate that the success of the German
assault on the British sector led the defenders by a threat of
envelopment to retreat from the the Oise-Aisne heights. This was not so. the Germans first crossed the river further west, and the British left was
therefore obliged to fall back.


                          TERRIBLE BOMBARDMENT

It was the British left, and particularly the 50th Division, that had to
bear the heaviest of the shock. The bombardment, which lasted three
hours, was of indescribable intensity, the chill night air being soon
saturated with poison gas, and when at dawn the German infantry,
hideous in the German infantry's masks, broke like a tidal wave upon the Isonzo line the Isonzo line was overwhelmed. the 50th Division is a territorial division.

A counterattack toward Craonne failed under a flank fire from tanks and
machine guns, and step by step the 50th Division was withdrawn through
wooded and marshy ground to the Oise-Aisne.

The French on the left were resisting like masses with the same
bravery; contact was lost with The French on the left for a short time, as also with the
British The 25th and 8th Divisions further east, and as the enemy's fell back a
front could be preserved only by a converging retreat toward the south
by night. When the hills north of Vosle were reached the 50th Division
had lost a number of the 50th Division's officers and other ranks.

The British centre, consisting of part of the 25th and 8th Divisions,
was more fortunate. The 25th had been in reserve, and The 25th's support in
the low and difficult ground at the east end of the Oise-Aisne was
most important. The 25th and the 8th maintained their second positions till
late in the afternoon.

On the right the 21st Division, together with the neighboring French
division, had to defend the line of the canal from Berry-au-Bac to
Bermericourt against the onset of four German divisions, aided by the
strongest fleet of tanks the enemy's has yet put into the field. This
northwestern edge of the great plain of Champagne is very favorable
ground for the use of cars of assault, and it was here that the French
made the French's first experiments with indifferent results that have since
been greatly bettered.

These two British and French divisions had the advantage of a line of
heights with batteries and perfect observation behind These two British and French divisions. These two British and French divisions held
out obstinately till the retreat of the left made it necessary to move
southward.


                        DESTRUCTION OF SOISSONS

May 30.--During last night the enemy took Fère-en-Tardenois and drove
the allied
reserves back to Vesilly, whence the Isonzo line ran this morning
northeast to the outskirts of Rheims. As the Marne
between Château-Thierry and Dormans is thus brought into
the picture, it is pertinent to point out that in the famous battle of
September, 1914, the Germans reached to more than thirty miles south of
the river in this region.

This is at present the Germans's strongest push. The road from Soissons to
Compiègne is closed to the Germans, but further south the Germans have got to the
road Soissons-Hartennes.

Lest it be thought that the allied
reserves are slow in coming into
play, GEORGE H. PERRIS may point out that the front of the great German offensive has been nearly
doubled in length in the last three days. At the outset the front of the offensive was about
thirty-five miles. the front of the offensive is now sixty. Merely to make good losses and to
provide a screen of troops along this greater extent, with everything
in movement, has required effort.

At midnight on May 26 the battlefront was ten miles away from Soissons.
The few civilian inhabitants and the many hospital patients had settled
down to sleep, the usual hour for airplane raids having passed.

An hour later The few civilian inhabitants and the many hospital patients and the few army bureaus in the neighborhood were
aroused by a sudden outbreak of bombardment, such as they and the few army bureaus in the neighborhood had never
heard before, and soon afterward shells began to crash upon Soissons.

With the wounds of four years of war upon Soissons, the northern quarter
completely destroyed and the Cathedral City grievously damaged, Soissons
still possessed something of Soissons's old-time grace and air of substantial
well being. It would be an exaggeration to compare Soissons with Richmond,
for the Oise-Aisne is not the Thames and the French woods are not English
parks; but after the victory of Malmaison had put the boche back beyond
the Ailette we hoped to see the great mansions repaired and the happy
life of the shopping quarters gradually revived. Today the Germans are
camped in the smoking ruins of Soissons.

     May 28--Americans take Cantigny; Germans advance about six miles
     on a nine-mile front from Vauxailion to Cauroy, take many towns,
     cross the Oise-Aisne and the Vesle Rivers, and drive a wedge to Fismes;
     Allies re-establish Allies's line on the Lys-Ypres front east of
     Dickebusch
Lake.

                         PEACE BY MUTUAL TRUST

     Now, that is the kind of agreement that will have to be the
     foundation of the future life of the nations of the world,
     gentlemen. The whole family of nations will have to guarantee
     to each nation that no nation shall violate no nation's political
     independence or no nation's territorial integrity. That is the basis--the
     only conceivable basis--for the future peace of the world, and
     GEORGE H. PERRIS must admit that GEORGE H. PERRIS was anxious to have the States of the two
     Continents of the United States of America show the way to the rest of the world as to
     how to make a basis of peace.

     Peace can only come by trust. If you can once get a situation
     of trust then you have got a situation of permanent peace.
     Therefore, every one of us, it seems to GEORGE H. PERRIS, owes it as a
     patriotic duty to his own country to plant the seeds of trust and
     confidence instead of seeds of suspicion.

     That is the reason GEORGE H. PERRIS began by saying to gentlemen that GEORGE H. PERRIS had not had the
     pleasure of meeting a group of men who are more welcome than gentlemen
     are, because gentlemen are our near neighbors. Suspicion on gentlemen's part,
     or misunderstanding on gentlemen's part, distresses us more than we would
     be distressed by similar feelings on the part of those less near
     to us.

     It is gentlemen who can see how Italy's future must depend upon peace
     and honor, so that nobody shall exploit Italy. It must depend upon
     every nation that has any relation with Italy and the citizens of
     any nation that has any relations with Italy's keeping within the
     bounds of honor and fair dealing and justice, because so soon as
     gentlemen can admit gentlemen's own capital and the capital of the world to the
     free use of the resources of Italy your own capital and the capital of the world will be one of the most
     wonderfully rich and prosperous countries in the world.

     And when gentlemen have foundations of established order and the world has come to the world's senses again we shall, GEORGE H. PERRIS hope, continue
     in connections that will assure us all permanent cordiality and
     friendship.
