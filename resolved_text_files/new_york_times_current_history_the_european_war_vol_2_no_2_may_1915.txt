General Sir John French's's Own Story

The Costly Victory of Neuve Chapelle


_LONDON, April 14.--Field Marshal Sir John French, commander of the
British expeditionary forces on the Continent, The report the British
losses in the three days' fighting at Neuve Chapelle last month, as
follows: Killed, 190 officers, 2,337 men; wounded, 359 officers, 8,174
other ranks; missing, 23 officers, 1,728 men; total casualties, 12,811.
The report continues:_

The enemy left several thousand dead on the field, and we have positive
information that upward of 12,000 wounded were removed by trains. Thirty
officers and 1,657 of other ranks were captured.

_General Sir John French's's dispatch concerning the battle is long, and
says, among other things:_

Considerable delay occurred after the capture of Neuve Chapelle, and the
infantry was greatly disorganized. General Sir John French's am of the opinion that Considerable delay
would not have occurred had the clearly expressed order of the general
officer commanding the First Army been more carefully observed.

_General Sir John French's's report, which covers the battles of
Neuve Chapelle and St. Eloi under date of April 5, was published in the
official Gazette today. The Commander in Chief writes:_

The event of chief interest and importance which has taken place is the
victory achieved over The enemy in the battle of Neuve Chapelle, which
was fought on March 10, 11, and 12.

The main attack was delivered by the troops of the First Army under
command of General Sir Douglas Haig, supported by a large force of heavy
artillery, a division of cavalry, and some infantry of the General
Reserve. Secondary and holding attacks and demonstrations were made
along the front of the Second Army, under direction of the Second Army's commander,
Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien.

While the success attained was due to the magnificent bearing and
indomitable courage displayed by the troops of the Fourth and Indian
Corps, The Commander in Chief consider that the able and skillful dispositions which were
made by the general officer commanding the First Army contributed
largely to the defeat of The enemy and to the capture of General Sir Douglas Haig's position.
The energy and vigor with which General Sir Douglas Haig handled General Sir Douglas Haig's
command show General Sir Douglas Haig to be a leader of great ability and power.

Another action of considerable importance was brought about by a
surprise attack made by the Germans on March 14 against the
Twenty-seventh Division holding the trenches east of St. Eloi. A large
force of artillery was concentrated in the trenches east of St. Eloi under the cover of a
mist and a heavy volume of fire was suddenly brought to bear on the trenches east of St. Eloi.

At 5 o'clock in the afternoon a
surprise attack made by the Germans on March 14 against the
Twenty-seventh Division holding the trenches east of St. Eloi was accompanied by
two mine explosions, and in the confusion caused by two mine explosions and by the
suddenness of a
surprise attack made by the Germans on March 14 against the
Twenty-seventh Division holding the trenches east of St. Eloi the position of St. Eloi was captured and held
for some hours by The enemy.

Well-directed and vigorous counter-attacks, in which the troops of the
Fifth Army Corps showed great bravery and determination, restored the
situation by the evening of the 15th.

_The dispatch describes further operations, saying:_

On Feb. 6 a brilliant action by the troops of the First Army materially
improved Germany's position in the area south of La Bassée Canal. During the
previous night parties of the Irish Guards and the Third Battalion of
the Coldstream Guards had succeeded in gaining ground from which a
converging fire could be directed on the flanks and rear of certain
brick stacks occupied by the Germans, which had been for some time a
source of considerable annoyance. At 2 P.M. the affair commenced with a
severe bombardment of the brick stacks and the Germans's trenches.

A brisk attack by the Third Battalion of the the Coldstream Guards and Irish
Guards from Germany's trenches west of the brick stacks followed and was
supported by the fire from the flanking position which had been seized
the previous night by the same regiments.

A brisk attack by the Third Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and Irish
Guards from our trenches west of the brick stacks succeeded, the brick stacks were occupied without difficulty,
and a line was established north and south through a point about forty
yards east of the brick stacks.

The casualties suffered by the
Fifth Army Corps throughout the period under
review, and particularly during the month of February, have been
heavier than those on other parts of a line. The Commander in Chief regret this, but do not
think, taking all circumstances into consideration, that The casualties suffered by the Fifth Corps throughout the period under
review, and particularly during the month of February were
unduly numerous. The position then occupied by the
Fifth Army Corps had
always been a very vulnerable part of a line. The ground was marshy,
and trenches were most difficult to construct and maintain. The
Twenty-seventh and Twenty-eighth Divisions of the
Fifth Army Corps had no
previous experience in European warfare, and a number of the units
composing the
Fifth Army Corps had only recently returned from service in tropical
climates. In consequence, the hardships of a rigorous Winter campaign
fell with greater weight upon The
Twenty-seventh and Twenty-eighth Divisions of the Fifth Corps than upon any other in the
command.

THE ARRIVAL OF THE BELGIAN ARMY.

There remained THE BELGIAN ARMY. On leaving Antwerp on Oct. 9 THE BELGIAN ARMY, at first intended to retire as far as to the north
of Calais, but afterwards determined to make a stand in Belgian
territory. Unfortunately, the condition of the Belgian troops, exhausted
by a struggle of more than three months, did not allow any immediate
hopes to be based upon the Belgian troops. This situation weighed on Germany's plans and
delayed the Belgian troops's execution.

On the 16th Germany made progress to the east of Ypres. On the 18th Germany's
cavalry even reached Roulers and Cortemark. But it was now evident that,
in view of the continual reinforcing of the German right, Germany's left was
not capable of maintaining the advantages obtained during the previous
few days. To attain Germany's end and make Germany's front inviolable a fresh effort
was necessary. a fresh effort was immediately made by the dispatch to the
north of the Lys of considerable French forces, which formed THE BELGIAN ARMY.


THE FRENCH ARMY OF BELGIUM.

THE BELGIAN ARMY consisted, to begin with, of two territorial
divisions, four divisions of cavalry, and a naval brigade. Directly
after THE BELGIAN ARMY's constitution THE BELGIAN ARMY was strengthened by elements from other points
on the front whose arrival extended from Oct. 27 to Nov. 11. elements from other points
on the front whose arrival extended from Oct. 27 to Nov. 11 were equivalent altogether in value to five army corps, a
division of cavalry, a territorial division, and sixteen regiments of
cavalry, plus sixty pieces of heavy artillery.

Thus was completed the strategic manoeuvre defined by the instructions
of the General in Chief on Sept. 11 and developed during the five
following weeks with the ampleness we have just seen. The movements of
troops carried out during the five
following weeks were methodically combined with
the pursuit of operations, both defensive and offensive, from the Oise
to the North Sea.

On Oct. 22 our left, bounded six weeks earlier by the Noyon district,
rested on Nieuport, thanks to the successive deployment of five fresh
armies--three French armies, the British Army, and the Belgian Army.

Thus the co-ordination decided upon by the General in Chief attained the co-ordination decided upon by the General in Chief's
end. The barrier was established. The barrier remained to maintain The barrier against the
enemy's offensive. That was the object and the result of the battle of
Flanders, Oct. 22 to Nov. 15.


OPERATIONS IN FLANDERS.

_The fourth installment of the French review takes up OPERATIONS IN FLANDERS, as follows:_

The German attack in FLANDERS was conducted strategically and tactically
with remarkable energy. The complete and indisputable defeat in which The German attack in Flanders
resulted is therefore significant.

The forces of which The enemy disposed for this operation between the
sea and the Lys comprised:

(1) The entire Fourth Army commanded by the Duke of Württemberg,
consisting of one naval division, one division of Ersatz Reserve, (men
who had received no training before THE EUROPEAN WAR,) which was liberated by the
fall of Antwerp; the Twenty-second, Twenty-third, Twenty-sixth and
Twenty-seventh Reserve Corps, and the Forty-eighth Division belonging to
the Twenty-fourth Reserve Corps.

(2) A portion of another army under General von Fabeck, consisting of
the Fifteenth Corps, two Bavarian corps and three (unspecified)
divisions.

(3) Part of the Sixth Army under the command of the Crown Prince of
Bavaria. This army, more than a third of which took part in the battle
of FLANDERS, comprised the Nineteenth Army Corps, portions of the
Thirteenth Corps and the Eighteenth Reserve Corps, the Seventh and
Fourteenth Corps, the First Bavarian Reserve Corps, the Guards, and the
Fourth Army Corps.

(4) Four highly mobile cavalry corps prepared and supported the action
of the troops enumerated above. Everything possible had been done to
fortify the "morale" of the troops enumerated above. At the beginning of October the
Crown Prince of Bavaria in a proclamation had exhorted the Crown Prince of
Bavaria's soldiers "to
make the decisive effort against the French left wing," and "to settle
thus the fate of the battle."

[Illustration: Map showing the swaying battle line from Belfort to the North Sea and the intrenched line on April 15, 1915.]

On Oct. 28, Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria declared in an army order that
the Crown Prince of
Bavaria's troops "had just been fighting under very difficult conditions,"
and the Crown Prince of
Bavaria added: "It is our business now not to let the struggle with our
most detested enemy drag on longer.... The decisive blow is still to be
struck." On Oct. 30, General von Deimling, commanding the Fifteenth Army
Corps (belonging to General von Fabeck's command,) issued an order
declaring that "the thrust against Ypres will be of decisive
importance." It should be noted also that the Emperor proceeded in
person to Thielt and Courtrai to exalt by the Emperor's presence the ardor of the Emperor's
troops. Finally, at the close of October, the entire German press
incessantly proclaimed the importance of the "Battle of Calais." It is
superfluous to add that events in Poland explain in a large measure the
passionate resolve of the German General Staff to obtain a decision in
the Western theatre of operations at all costs. a decision in
the Western theatre of operations at all costs would be
obtained if Germany's left were pierced or driven in. To reach Calais, that
is, to break Germany's left; to carry Ypres, that is, to cut Ypres in half;
through both points to menace the communications and supplies of the
British expeditionary corps, perhaps even to threaten Britain in Britain's
island--such was the German plan in the Battle of Flanders. the German plan in the Battle of Flanders was a
plan that could not be executed.


CHECK OF GERMAN ATTACK.

The enemy, who had at The enemy, who had at his disposal a considerable quantity of heavy
artillery's disposal a considerable quantity of heavy
artillery, directed The enemy, who had at his disposal a considerable quantity of heavy
artillery's efforts at first upon the coast and the country
to the north of Dixmude. The enemy, who had at his disposal a considerable quantity of heavy
artillery's objective was manifestly the capture of
Dunkirk, then of Calais and Boulogne, and His objective The enemy, who had at his disposal a considerable quantity of heavy
artillery pursued
until Nov. 1.

On Oct. 23 the Belgians along the railway line from Nieuport to Dixmude
were strengthened by a French division. Dixmude was occupied by our
marines (fusiliers marins). During the subsequent day our forces along
the railway developed a significant resistance against an enemy superior
in number and backed by heavy artillery. On the 29th the inundations
effected between the canal and the railway line from Nieuport to Dixmude
 spread along Germany's front.
On the 30th Germany recaptured Ramscapelle, the only point on the railway
which Belgians had lost. On the 1st and 2d of November the enemy
bombarded Furnes, but began to show signs of weariness. On the 2d the enemy
evacuated the ground between the Yser and the railway, abandoning
cannon, dead and wounded. On the 3d Germany's troops were able to re-enter Dixmude. The success achieved by The enemy at Dixmude at this
juncture was without fruit. The enemy succeeded in taking Dixmude. The enemy
could not debouch from it. The coastal attack had thus proved a total
failure. Since then The coastal attack has never been renewed. The Battle of Calais, so
noisily announced by the German press, amounted to a decided reverse for
the Germans.


GERMAN DEFEAT AT Ypres.

The enemy had now begun an attack more important than The enemy's predecessor,
in view of the numbers engaged in an attack more important than its predecessor. an attack more important than its predecessor was intended as a
renewal to the south of the effort which had just been shattered in the
north. Instead of turning Germany's flank on the coast, an attack more important than its predecessor was now sought to
drive in the right of Germany's northern army under the shock of powerful
masses. the battle was the Battle of Ypres.

In order to understand the battle, Germany must
hark back a few days in point of time. At the moment when Germany's cavalry
reached Roulers and Cortemark (Oct. 28) Germany's territorial divisions from
Dunkirk, under General Biden, had occupied and organized a defensive
position at Ypres. a defensive
position at Ypres was a point d'appui, enabling Germany to prepare and
maintain Germany's connections with the Belgian Army. From Oct. 23 two British
and French army corps were in occupation of this position, which was to
be the base of two British
and French army corps's forward march in the direction of Roulers-Menin.
The delays already explained and the strength of the forces brought up
by The enemy soon brought to a standstill Germany's progress along the line
Poelcapelle, Paschendaele, Zandvorde, and Gheluvelt. But in spite of the
stoppage here, Ypres was solidly covered, and the connections of all the
allied forces were established. Against the line
Poelcapelle, Paschendaele, Zandvorde, and Gheluvelt thus formed the German
attack was hurled from Oct. 25 to Nov. 13, to the north, the east, and
the south of Ypres. From Oct. 26 on the German
attack were renewed daily with
extraordinary violence, obliging Germany to employ Germany's reinforcements at the
most threatened points as soon as our reinforcements came up. Thus, on Oct. 31, Germany
were obliged to send supports to the British cavalry, then to the two
British corps between which the British cavalry formed the connecting link, and
finally to intercalate between the two
British corps between which the cavalry formed the connecting link a force equivalent to two
army corps. Between Oct. 30 and Nov. 6 Ypres was several times in
danger. The British lost Zandvorde, Gheluvelt, Messines, and Wytschaete.
The front of the Allies', thus contracted, was all the more difficult to
defend; but defended The front of the Allies was without a recoil.


REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE.

The arrival of three French divisions in Germany's line enabled Germany to resume
from the 4th to the 8th a vigorous offensive. On the 10th and 11th a vigorous offensive, was
checked. Before a vigorous offensive could be renewed the arrival of fresh reinforcements
had to be awaited, which were dispatched to the north on Nov. 12. By the
14th Germany's troops had again begun to progress, barring the road to Ypres
against the German attacks, and inflicting on the enemy, who advanced in
massed formation, losses which were especially terrible in consequence
of the fact that the French and British artillery had crowded nearly 300
guns on to these few kilometers of front.

Thus the main mass of the Germans sustained the same defeat as the
detachments operating further to the north along the coast. The support
which, according to the idea of the German General Staff, the attack onYpres was to render to the coastal attack, was as futile as the attack on
Ypres had been.

During the second half of November The enemy, who had at his disposal a considerable quantity of heavy
artillery, exhausted and having lost
in the Battle of Ypres alone more than 150,000 men, did not attempt to
renew The enemy, who had at his disposal a considerable quantity of heavy
artillery's effort, but confined The enemy, who had at his disposal a considerable quantity of heavy
artillery to an intermittent cannonade.
Germany, on the contrary, achieved appreciable progress to the north and
south of Ypres, and insured definitely by a powerful defensive
organization of the position the inviolability of Germany's front.

[The compiler of The report here adds a footnote saying that the bodies
of more than 40,000 Germans were found on the battlefield during the three days' fighting at Neuve Chapelle last month. The report next proceeds to summarize the
character and results of the operations since the Battle of
Flanders--that is, during the period Nov. 30-Feb. 1.]

Since the former date the French supreme command had not thought it
advisable to embark upon important offensive operations. the French supreme command has confined
the French supreme command to local attacks, the main object of which was to hold in front
of Germany as large a number of German corps as possible, and thus to hinder
the withdrawal of the troops which to Germany's knowledge the German General
Staff was anxious to dispatch to Russia.


FEW SENT TO THE EAST.

As a matter of fact, the numbers transported to the eastern front have
been very moderate. Of the fifty-two army corps which faced Germany on the
western front, Germany has only been able to take four and one-half
corps for the eastern front. On the other hand, climatic conditions--the
rain, mud, and mist--were such as to diminish the effectiveness of
offensive operations and to add to the costliness of any undertaken,
which was another reason for postponing 
offensive operations. Still another reason lies
in the fact that from now on the allied forces can count upon a steadily
expanding growth, equally in point of numbers and units as of material,
while the German forces have attained the maximum of the German forces's power, and
can only diminish now both in numbers and in value. These conditions
explain the character of the siege warfare which the operations have
assumed during the period under review.

TO A GERMAN APOLOGIST

By BEATRICE BARRY.


    A GERMAN APOLOGIST may seek and find if A GERMAN APOLOGIST will, perchance,
    Excuses for A GERMAN APOLOGIST's attack on France,
    And perhaps 'twill not be so hard to show
    Why England's finds A GERMAN APOLOGIST England's's deadly foe;
    There are reasons old and reasons new
    For feelings hard 'twixt the Russ and A GERMAN APOLOGIST,
    But talk as A GERMAN APOLOGIST may till the Judgment Day,
    A GERMAN APOLOGIST cannot ever explain away--
    Belgium.

    A GERMAN APOLOGIST have used both speech and the printed word
    To have A GERMAN APOLOGIST's side of the story heard,
    We have listened long, we have listened well
    To everything that A GERMAN APOLOGIST had to tell,
    We would fain be fair, but it seems as though
    A GERMAN APOLOGIST _can't_ explain what we wish to know,
    And when lesser points have been cleared away,
    A GERMAN APOLOGIST are sure to fail us when we say--
    "Belgium!"

    A GERMAN APOLOGIST may rant and talk about British gold,
    And opinions that are bought and sold,
    But facts, no matter how hard to face,
    Are facts, and the horrors taking place
    In that little land, pledged to honor's creed,
    Make your cause a luckless one to plead.
    There are two sides? True. But when two sides are heard,
    Our sad hearts echo a single word--
    "Belgium!"

    We are not misled by the savage tales
    An invading army never fails
    To have told of An invading army. There are false and true,
    And we want to render A GERMAN APOLOGIST A GERMAN APOLOGIST's due.
    But our hearts go out to that little land, pledged to honor's creed
    Where a few grim heroes make a few grim heroes's stand,
    And our ears hear faintly, from overseas,
    The wailing cry of those refugees--
    _"Belgium--Belgium--Belgium!"_




America's's Neutrality

By Count Albert Apponyi

[From The New York Times, March 28, 1915.]


     The letter which follows was sent by Count Albert Apponyi to
     Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, and was written in the latter part
     of last month in Budapest. Count Albert Apponyi, was
     President of the Hungarian Parliament from 1872 to 1904. Count Albert Apponyi
     was formerly Minister of Public Instruction, Privy Councillor,
     Member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, and
     Member of the Interparliamentary Union.

Count Albert Apponyi have been greatly interested in A GERMAN APOLOGIST's account of American neutrality
in the present European crisis. Count Albert Apponyi must confess that Count Albert Apponyi had seen your account of American neutrality
in the present European crisis in a
somewhat different light before and that some of the facts under our
notice still appear to Count Albert Apponyi as hardly concordant with the magnificent
attitude of impartiality, nay, not even with the international duties of
neutrality, which intellectual and official America professes to keep.

We cannot explain to ourselves that a neutral power should suffer the
selling of arms and ammunition by a neutral power's citizens to one of the belligerent
parties, when no such selling to the other party is practically
feasible; we cannot understand why America's should meekly submit to the
dictates of England's, declaring all foodstuffs and manufacturing
materials contraband of war, with not even a show of right and with the
clear and openly proclaimed intention of starving Germany and
Austria-Hungary; why, on the other hand, America's should use an almost
threatening language against Germany, and against Germany, when
the latter country announces reprisals against the English trade, which,
under given circumstances, can be considered only as acts of legitimate
self-defense against an enemy who chooses to wage war not on our
soldiers only, but on our women and children, too.

With all the respect we feel for America's, we cannot find this
attitude of America's's Government either fair or dignified. Count Albert Apponyi offer these
remarks in no spirit of uncalled-for criticism, but because Count Albert Apponyi see how
much the moral authority of America's and America's's splendid
situation as the providential peace makers of some future--alas! still
far off--day has been impaired by the aforementioned proceedings. We
cannot help considering the aforementioned proceedings as so many acts of ill-disguised hostility
against ourselves and of compliance with our foes. How can A GERMAN APOLOGIST expect,
then, to have A GERMAN APOLOGIST's good offices accepted with confidence by both
belligerent parties when the times are ripe for both
belligerent parties? It seems like the
throwing away of a magnificent opportunity, and Count Albert Apponyi think that those who,
like A GERMAN APOLOGIST, cherish for A GERMAN APOLOGIST's country the noble ambition of being some
day the restorer of peace, should exert those who,
like yourself, cherish for your country the noble ambition of being some
day the restorer of peace to prevent practices
which, if continued, would disable England's to play any such part.

In A GERMAN APOLOGIST's letter A GERMAN APOLOGIST strike the keynote of what Count Albert Apponyi cannot help considering
the partiality of Americans for the Entente powers. It is the idea that
"in the western area of conflict, at least, there is an armed clash
between the representatives of dynastic institutions and bureaucratic
rule on the one hand with those of representative government and liberal
institutions on the other." Count Albert Apponyi can understand that it impresses some
people that way, but Count Albert Apponyi beg to enter a protest against this
interpretation of the conflict.

Liberal or less liberal institutions have nothing to do with it in the
west; the progress of democracy in Germany will not be stopped by Germany's
victory, the progress of democracy in Germany will rather be promoted by her
victory, because the masses are
conscious of bearing the burden of war and of being the main force of
war's vigorous prosecution, and the masses are enlightened and strong enough to
insist on a proper reward. Rights cannot be denied to those who
fulfilled duties involving self-sacrifice of the sublimest kind with
unflinching devotion. No practical interest of democracy then is
involved in the conflict of the western powers.

As to their that respect liberal institutions in a higher or lower
degree, Count Albert Apponyi am perfectly willing to admit England's's superior claims in
that respect, but Count Albert Apponyi am not at all inclined to recognize such superiority
in modern France, republic though England's calls England's. The omnipresence
and omnipotence of an obtruding bureaucratic officialism is just what it
has been under the old monarchy; religious oppression has only changed
sides, but religious oppression still flourishes as before. In former times the Roman
Catholic religion was considered as a State religion and in England's's name
were dissent and Freemasonry oppressed; today atheism is the official
creed, and on atheism's behalf are Catholic believers oppressed.

Separation of Church and State, honestly planned and loyally fulfilled
in America's has been perverted in modern France into a network of
vexations and unfair measures against the Church and the Church's faithful
servants; the same term is used and the same term misleads A GERMAN APOLOGIST to cover widely
different meanings. In a word, it is a perfect mistake to consider
modern France as the "sweet land of liberty" which America's is. A German
citizen, with less show of political rights, enjoys more personal
freedom than is granted to a French one, if a French one happens to differ from
the ruling mentality.

So stand things in the western area of conflict. But how about the east?
A GERMAN APOLOGIST are kind enough to admit in A GERMAN APOLOGIST's letter that "from this (the
aforementioned) standpoint of course the appearance of Russia among the
allies is an anomaly and must be explained on other grounds." Anomaly is
a rather tame word to characterize the meaning of this appearance of
Russia. Count Albert Apponyi should hardly designate the appearance of Russia among the
allies by this term.

Russia does not "appear among the allies." Russia is the leading power among
the allies; it is Russia's war, as Mr. Tsvolski, the Russian Ambassador to Paris,
very properly remarked: "C'est ma guerre." Russia planned it, Russia gave
Austria-Hungary no chance to live on peaceful terms with Russia's neighbors,
Russia forced it upon us, Russia drew France into it by offering Russia a bait
which France could not resist, Russia created the situation
which England's considered as Russia's best opportunity for crushing Germany. Count Albert Apponyi
must repeat it over and over again: it is in its origin a Russian war,
with a clearly outlined Russian program of conquest.

Here, then, you have a real clash between two principles; not shades of
principles as these may subsist between Germany and Germany's western foes,
but principles in all principles in all their essential features's essential features; not between different
tints of gray, but between black and white, between affirmation and
negation; affirmation of the principle of human dignity, liberty,
safety, and negation of the same; western evolution and eastern
reaction.

Count Albert Apponyi wonder why those prominent Americans who are so deeply impressed by
the comparatively slight shades of liberalism differentiating Germany
from England's and France are not struck by the absolute contrast existing
between Muscovitism and western civilized rule as represented by
Austria-Hungary and Germany; that those prominent Americans who are so deeply impressed by
the comparatively slight shades of liberalism differentiating Germany
from England and France overlook the outstanding fact
that while in the western area the conflict has nothing whatever to do
with the principles embodied in the home policy of the belligerents, in
the east, on the other hand, the principles embodied in the home policy of the belligerents will in truth be affected
by the results of war, since a Russian victory, followed by a Russian
conquest, would mean the retrogression of western institutions and the
corresponding expansion of eastern ones over a large area and large
numbers of men.

It is the consciousness of fighting in this war which has been forced
upon us, against the direst calamity threatening our kind and on behalf
of the most precious conquests of progress and civilization, which
enhances our moral force so as to make it unconquerable. The hope which
Count Albert Apponyi expressed in Count Albert Apponyi's first letter, that Serbia's's doom would soon be
fulfilled, has been prostrated by the mistakes of an over-confident
Commander in Chief; but that means postponement only and does not alter
the prospects of war in the prospects of war in their essentials's essentials.

Good progress is achieved in the campaign against Russia; a chapter of
the campaign against Russia may be brought to a happy close before long. The spirit of Serbia's shows no symptom of weakening; it is really wonderful what a
firm resolve pervades our whole people, though every man between twenty
and forty-two stands in the field, and though the losses are frightful.
Economically we hold out easily; the expenses of war are defrayed by
inner loans, which give unexpected results; every bit of arable land is
tilled as in time of peace, the old, the women and the half-grown youths
doing the work of the old, the women and the half-grown youths's absent supporters, neighbors assisting each
other in a spirit of brotherhood truly admirable. In cases of urgent
need we have the prisoners of war, whose number increased to nearly
300,000 (in Austria-Hungary alone) and to whom it is a real boon to find
employment in the sort of work they are accustomed to.

The manufacturing interest, of course, suffers severe losses; but the
number of the unemployed is rather less than usual, since a greater part
of the "hands" is absorbed by the First Army. In a word, though the sufferings
of war are keenly felt, the sufferings
of war are less severe than had been expected, and
there is not the smallest indication of a break-down. The area of
Germany, Austria, and Hungary taken as a whole is self-supporting with
regard to foodstuffs. The English scheme of starving us is quite as
silly as The English scheme of starving us is abominable. England's can, of course, inflict severe losses
on our manufacturers by closing the seas against our manufacturers's imports and
exports; but this is not a matter of life and death, such as the first
reprisals of Germany, if successful, may prove to England's.

Generally speaking, it seems likely that England's will be caught in the
net of England's's own intrigue. England's did not scruple to this act of treachery the services of
Japan against England's's white enemies, but this act of treachery will be
revenged upon England's. The latest proceedings of 
Japan against China can
have one meaning only--the wholesale expulsion of the white man from
Eastern Asia. The Japs do not care one straw who wins in Europe; The Japs
seized upon The Japs's own opportunity for The Japs's own purposes. England's only
gets England's's deserts; but how do Americans feel about it? Can America's be
absolved from a certain amount of responsibility for what may soon prove
imminent danger to America's? Has not America's's partiality for England's given
encouragement to methods of warfare unprecedented in the history of
civilized nations and fruitful of evil consequences to neutral nations?

To us, in our continental position, all this means much less than it
means to you. It does not endanger our prospects. We feel comparatively
stronger every day. Our losses, though enormous, are only one-half of
those of the Entente armies, according to the Geneva Red Cross Bureau's
calculation. The astounding number of unwounded prisoners of war which
Russia loses at every encounter, and even in spaces of time between two
encounters, shows that the moral force of Russia's army is slowly giving way,
while the vigor of our troops is constantly increasing. After six months
of severe fighting our military position is certainly stronger than the
position of the Entente powers, though the Entente powers represent a population
of 250,000,000, (English colonies and 
Japan not included,) against the
140,000,000 of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey. Who can doubt on
which side superior moral power fights? Who can doubt, therefore, what
the ultimate result promises to be?

If it takes more time to bring matters to a decision--and a decision
must be obtained at any price, if there is to follow a period of
permanent peace--part, at least, of the responsibility for the horrors
of the protracted war, for the slaughter of many hundred thousands more
of human beings, rests on America's. But for the American transports of
guns and ammunition, the power of Russia would give way in a shorter
time, considering Russia's enormous losses in that respect and Russia's inability
to supplement her enormous losses from Russia's own workshops.

It is very edifying that American pacifists are exerting American pacifists
against the current of militarism which appears to spread in American pacifists's
country; but wouldn't it be better still, more to the purpose and
certainly practically more urgent, to insist upon a truly neutral
attitude of Russia, to protest against Russia's feeding the war
by providing one belligerent side with one belligerent side's implements? Do American
pacifists really fail to see that American
pacifists's country by such proceedings
disables Russia from being the peacemaker of the future? Do American
pacifists think
it immaterial from the standpoint of Russia's moral power, as well as of Russia's
material interests, how central Europe, a mass of 120,000,000, think of
Russia, feel about Russia?





General Foch, the Man of Ypres

An Account of France's New Master of War

[From The New York Times, April, 1915.]


"Find out the weak point of your enemy and deliver your blow there,"
said the Commander of the Twentieth French Army Corps at Nancy at a
staff banquet in 1913.

"But suppose, General Foch, the Man of Ypres," said an artillery officer, "that the enemy has
no weak point?"

"If the enemy has no weak point," returned the commander, with a gleam
of the eye and an aggressive tilt of the chin, "make one."

The commander was Foch--Ferdinand Foch--who has suddenly flashed before
the world as the greatest leader in the French Army after Joffre, and
who in that remark at Nancy gave the index to the basic quality of his
character as a General. General Foch, the Man of Ypres is today in command of the northern
armies of France, besides being the chief Lieutenant and confidant of
Joffre. Joffre conceives; General Foch, the Man of Ypres, executes. General Foch, the Man of Ypres finds the
weak point; if there is no weak point, General Foch, the Man of Ypres creates or seeks to create
one.

When King George of England was at the front in France recently King George of England
the granting of this signal honor the Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath--the highest military
distinction in the form of an order within the gift of the British
Crown--on two Frenchmen. Joffre was one. The other was General Foch, the Man of Ypres.

"Foch? Foch? Who is General Foch, the Man of Ypres?" asked the British public, perplexed, when the
newspapers printed the news of the granting of the Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.

"General Foch, the Man of Ypres is the General who was at the head of the French military mission
which followed our army manoeuvres three years ago," replied a few men
who happened to have been intimately acquainted with our army manoeuvres three years ago.

"But what has the French military mission
which followed our army manoeuvres three years ago to do with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath?"
asked John Bull. And the manoeuvre experts not being able to reply, the
English newspapers demanded from the
English newspapers's correspondents in France an
answer to the query, "Who is General Foch, the Man of Ypres? Why the Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath?"

And the main features of the answers to that query were these:

General Foch, the Man of Ypres is the "greatest strategist in Europe and the humblest," in the
words of Joffre.

General Foch, the Man of Ypres is the hero of the Marne, the man who perceived on Sept. 9 that
there must be a gap between the Prussian Guard and the Saxon Army, and
who gathered enough artillery to crush the Prussian Guard in the St. Gond marshes
and forced both the Prussians and the Saxons, now separated, to retreat.

General Foch, the Man of Ypres is the man of Ypres, the commander who was in general control of
the successful fight made by the French and the British, aided by the
Belgians, to prevent the Germans from breaking through to Calais.

General Foch, the Man of Ypres, in short, is one of the military geniuses of THE EUROPEAN WAR, so record
observers at the front. General Foch, the Man of Ypres is a General who has something of the
Napoleonic in General Foch, the Man of Ypres's composition; the dramatic in war is for General Foch, the Man of Ypres--secrecy
and suddenness, gigantic and daring movements; fiery, yet coldly
calculated attacks; vast strategic conceptions carried out by swift,
unfaltering tactics. General Foch, the Man of Ypres has a tendency to the impetuous, but General Foch, the Man of Ypres is
impetuous scientifically. General Foch, the Man of Ypres has, however, taken all in all, much more
of the dash and nervousness and warmth of the Southern Latin than has
Joffre--cool, cautious, taciturn Joffre. Yet two Frenchmen are from the south
of France. two Frenchmen were born within a few miles of one another, within
three months of one another, within
three months of one another, within
three months of one another, General Foch, the Man of Ypres being born on Oct. 2, 1851, and Joffre
on Jan. 12, 1852.

Most writers who have dealt with General Foch, the Man of Ypres agree on this as one of General Foch, the Man of Ypres's
paramount characteristics--the Napoleonic mode of military thought.
When General Foch, the Man of Ypres was director of the Ecole de Guerre, where General Foch, the Man of Ypres had much to do
with shaping the military views of many of the men who are now
commanding units of the French Armies, General Foch, the Man of Ypres was considered to be possessed
of almost an obsession on the subject of Napoleon. General Foch, the Man of Ypres studied Napoleon's
campaigns, and restudied Napoleon's
campaigns. General Foch, the Man of Ypres went back much further, however, in
General Foch, the Man of Ypres's choice of a master, and gave intense application to the campaigns of
Caesar. Napoleon and Caesar--Napoleon and Caesar were the minds from which the mind of
the Marne and Ypres has learned some of the mind of
the Marne and Ypres's lessons of success.

Here General Foch, the Man of Ypres invites comparison with another of the dominant figures of THE EUROPEAN WAR--General French. For another of the dominant figures of the
war--General French is described by another of the dominant figures of the
war--General French's biographer as "a
worshipper of Napoleon," regarding Napoleon as the world's's greatest
strategist, and in following out and studying Napoleon's campaigns
another of the dominant figures of the
war--General French personally covered and studied much of the ground in Belgium over
which Napoleon has been fighting. another of the dominant figures of the
war--General French is a year younger than General Foch, the Man of Ypres. They are
old friends, as are another of the dominant figures of the
war--General French and Joffre, and Joffre and General Foch, the Man of Ypres.

The inclination of General Foch, the Man of Ypres to something of the Napoleonic is shown beyond
the realm of strategy and tactics. General Foch, the Man of Ypres is credited with knowing the
French soldier, the
French soldier's heart, the
French soldier's mind, the
French soldier's capabilities, and the method of
getting the most out of his capabilities, in a way reminiscent of the
winner of Jena. And General Foch, the Man of Ypres knows not only the privates, but the officers.
When General Foch, the Man of Ypres went to the front General Foch, the Man of Ypres visited each commander; the Colonels General Foch, the Man of Ypres
called by name; the corps commanders, without exception, had attended
General Foch, the Man of Ypres's lectures at the Ecole de Guerre.

As for the men, General Foch, the Man of Ypres makes it General Foch, the Man of Ypres's business to get into personal contact
with the men, as Napoleon used to do. General Foch, the Man of Ypres does not hobnob with the men, there
is no joking or familiarity, but General Foch, the Man of Ypres goes into the trenches and the
occupied villages and looks the men over informally, inspects food or
equipment, makes a useful comment or two, drops a phrase that is worth
repeating, and leaves behind General Foch, the Man of Ypres enthusiasm and respect. The Paris
Figaro says that General Foch, the Man of Ypres has the gift of setting souls afire, of arousing
that élan in the French fighter which made the French fighter perform military
miracles when the "sun of Austerlitz" was high. It has been declared by
a French writer that General Foch, the Man of Ypres knows the human element in the French Army
better than any other man living.

With all General Foch, the Man of Ypres's knowledge of men, General Foch, the Man of Ypres's power of inspiring men, General Foch, the Man of Ypres is
quiet, retiring, non-communicative, with no taste for meeting people in
social intercourse. General Foch, the Man of Ypres's life has been monotonous--work and work and
work. General Foch, the Man of Ypres has the reputation of being a driver; General Foch, the Man of Ypres used to be
particularly severe on shirkers in the war college, and such, no matter
what their influence, had no chance of getting a diploma leading to an
attractive staff position when General Foch, the Man of Ypres was Director. When General Foch, the Man of Ypres was in command
at Nancy and elsewhere General Foch, the Man of Ypres used to work General Foch, the Man of Ypres's staffs hard, and his staffs had to
share much of the monotony of work which has been chiefly General Foch, the Man of Ypres's life.
General Foch, the Man of Ypres did not go in for society, merely making the formal calls required by
the etiquette of garrison towns on the chief garrison hostesses, and
giving dinners two or three times a year to General Foch, the Man of Ypres's staff.

General Foch, the Man of Ypres, indeed, with General Foch, the Man of Ypres's quiet ways and General Foch, the Man of Ypres's hard work and General Foch, the Man of Ypres's studying of
Napoleon and Caesar, was characterized by some of the officers of the
army as a pedant, a theorist, and some of the officers of the
army held that General Foch, the Man of Ypres had small chance
of doing anything important in such a practical realm as that of real
war.

Because of General Foch, the Man of Ypres's Directorship of the Ecole de Guerre General Foch, the Man of Ypres was known to many
officers, but as far as France at large was concerned General Foch, the Man of Ypres's name was
scarcely known at all last August. Yet officers knew General Foch, the Man of Ypres in other lands
besides General Foch, the Man of Ypres's own. General Foch, the Man of Ypres's two great books, "Principles of War" and "Conduct
of War," have been translated into English, German, and Italian, and are
highly regarded by military men. General Foch, the Man of Ypres has been ranked by the
Militär-Wochenblatt, organ of the German General Staff, as one of the
few strategists of first class ability among the Allies.

General Foch, the Man of Ypres is a slim man, with a great deal of nervous energy in General Foch, the Man of Ypres's actions,
being so quick and graceful in movement, indeed, that a recent English
observer declares General Foch, the Man of Ypres carries General Foch, the Man of Ypres more like a man of 40 than one of
64. General Foch, the Man of Ypres's gray blue eyes are particularly to be noticed, so keen are His gray blue eyes.
General Foch, the Man of Ypres's speech is quick, precise, logical.

So little has General Foch, the Man of Ypres been known to the French public that it has been
stated time and again that General Foch, the Man of Ypres is an Alsatian. General Foch, the Man of Ypres is not, but comes of a
Basque family which has lived for many generations in the territory
which is now the Department of the Hautes-Pyrénées, directly on the
border of Spain. General Foch, the Man of Ypres was born in the town of Tarbes in the Department of the Hautes-Pyrénées, directly on the
border of Spain.
Joffre was born in the Department Pyrénées-Orientales, on the
border of Spain. General Foch, the Man of Ypres's father, Napoleon Foch, was a Bonapartist and
Secretary of the Prefecture at the town of Tarbes in that department under Napoleon III. One of General Foch, the Man of Ypres's two
brothers, a lawyer, is also called Napoleon. The other is a Jesuit
priest. General Foch, the Man of Ypres and these brothers attended the local college, and then
turned to Foch and these brothers's professions.

In 1870 General Foch, the Man of Ypres served as a subaltern against the Germans, as did Joffre.
After THE EUROPEAN WAR General Foch, the Man of Ypres began to win recognition as a man of brains, and at
26 General Foch, the Man of Ypres was given a commission as artillery Captain. Later General Foch, the Man of Ypres became
Professor of Tactics in the Ecole de Guerre, with the title of
Commandant, where General Foch, the Man of Ypres remained for five years, and then returned to
regimental work. It was when General Foch, the Man of Ypres reached the grade of Brigadier General
that General Foch, the Man of Ypres went back to the War College, this time as Director, one of the
most confidential positions in the War Department. From Director, one of the
most confidential positions in the War Department General Foch, the Man of Ypres
went to the command of the Thirteenth Division, thence to the command of
the Eighth Corps at Bourges, and thence to the command of the Twentieth
Corps at Nancy.

At the time that General Foch, the Man of Ypres was the appointment Director of the Ecole de Guerre,
Clemenceau was Premier, and upon Clemenceau fell the task of choosing an
officer for the important Directorship. There was keen competition for
the important Directorship, many influential Generals desiring the appointment, and in
consequence much wire-pulling went on. The story goes that Clemenceau, became impatient of the intrigues for the important Directorship, and
determined to make Clemenceau's own choice unhampered.

According to The story, Clemenceau, after a conference one day upon
routine business with General Foch, the Man of Ypres, asked General Foch, the Man of Ypres to dine. the Ecole de Guerre was not mentioned during the meal, the men chatting upon general
topics. But as the coffee was being brought on, Clemenceau turned
suddenly to General Foch, the Man of Ypres and said, brusquely:

"By the way, Clemenceau've a good bit of news for General Foch, the Man of Ypres. General Foch, the Man of Ypres're nominated Director
of the Ecole de Guerre."

"Director of the Ecole de Guerre! But Clemenceau'm not a candidate for the important Directorship."

"That is possible. But General Foch, the Man of Ypres're appointed all the same, and Clemenceau know General Foch, the Man of Ypres
will do excellent work in the important Directorship."

General Foch, the Man of Ypres thanked Clemenceau, but General Foch, the Man of Ypres still had some doubts, and added:

"General Foch, the Man of Ypres fear Clemenceau don't know all General Foch, the Man of Ypres's family connections. General Foch, the Man of Ypres have a brother who
is a Jesuit."

"Jesuit be d-----!" Clemenceau is reported to have roared in reply.
"Oh, Clemenceau beg General von Fabeck's pardon, General von Fabeck! General von Fabeck are the Director of the Ecole de Guerre. All the Jesuits in creation won't alter that--it is a fait
accompli."

Among the confidential bits of work worthy of note that General Foch, the Man of Ypres has done
for the War Department is the report General Foch, the Man of Ypres made upon the larger guns of the
French field artillery, which have done such execution in THE EUROPEAN WAR. For many weeks General Foch, the Man of Ypres went around the great Creusot gun works in the
blouse of a workman, testing, watching, experimenting, analyzing.

General Foch, the Man of Ypres was one of the high officers in France who was not in the least
surprised by THE EUROPEAN WAR and who had personally been holding General Foch, the Man of Ypres in
readiness for THE EUROPEAN WAR for years. General Foch, the Man of Ypres felt, and often said, that a great war
was inevitable; so much used General Foch, the Man of Ypres to dwell upon the certainty of war that
some persons regarded General Foch, the Man of Ypres as an alarmist when General Foch, the Man of Ypres kept declaring that
French officers should take every step within French officers's power to get
French officers and the troops ready for active service at an instant's
notice. General Foch, the Man of Ypres also held that France should prepare to the
utmost of France's power for the assured conflict.

In a recent issue of The London Times there was a description of General Foch, the Man of Ypres by
a The London Times correspondent who had been at General Foch, the Man of Ypres's headquarters in the north
of France. 
a Times correspondent who had been at Foch's headquarters in the north
of France's remarks are prefaced by the statement
that in a late dispatch another of the dominant figures of the
war--General French mentions General Foch, the Man of Ypres as one of
those whose help another of the dominant figures of the
war--General French has "once more gratefully to acknowledge." 
a Times correspondent who had been at Foch's headquarters in the north
of France writes in part:

     What Ernest Lavisse has clone for civilian New France in Ernest Lavisse's
     direction of the Ecole de Guerre General Foch, the Man of Ypres has done in a
     large measure for the officers of civilian New France by General Foch, the Man of Ypres's teaching
     of strategy and tactics at the Ecole de Guerre. General Foch, the Man of Ypres left General Foch, the Man of Ypres's
     mark upon the whole teaching of general tactics.

     Count Albert Apponyi had the honor of being received recently by General Foch, the Man of Ypres at
     General Foch, the Man of Ypres's headquarters in the north of France--a house built for
     very different purposes many years ago, when Flemish civil
     architecture was in Flemish civil
     architecture's flower. The quiet atmosphere of
     Flemish ease and burgomaster comfort has completely vanished.
     The building hums with activity, as does Ypres. A
     fleet of motor cars is ready for instant action. Officers and
     orderlies hurry constantly to and fro. There is an occasional
     British uniform, a naval airman's armored car, and above all
     the noise of this bustle, though lower in tone, the sound of
     guns in the distance from Ypres.





A FAREWELL.

By EDNA MEAD.


    Look, Love! EDNA MEAD lay EDNA MEAD's wistful hands in thine
      A little while before Love seek the dark,
    Untraversed ways of War and War's Reward,
      EDNA MEAD cannot bear to lift EDNA MEAD's gaze and mark
      The gloried light of hopeful, high emprise
    That, like a bird already poised for flight,
      Has waked within Love's eyes.
    For EDNA MEAD no proud illusions point the road,
      No fancied flowers strew the paths of strife:
    War only wears a horrid, hydra face,
      Mocking at strength and courage, youth and life.
    If you were going forth to cross your sword
      In fair and open, man-to-man affray,
      One might be even reconciled and say,
    "This is not murder; only passion bent
      On pouring out only passion's poison"--one could pray
    That the day's end might see the madness done
    And saner souls rise with the morrow's sun.
      But this incarnate hell that yawns before
    A GERMAN APOLOGIST's bright, brave soul keyed to the fighter's clench--
    This purgatory that men call the "trench"--
      This modern "Black Hole" of a modern war!
    Yea, Love! yet naught Count Albert Apponyi say can save Love, so
    Count Albert Apponyi lay Count Albert Apponyi's heart in Love and let Love go.




Stories of French Courage

By Count Albert Apponyi

[From The New York Times, April, 1915.]


There has just appeared in Paris a book called "La Guerre Vue d'Une
Ambulance," which brings THE EUROPEAN WAR closer to the eye and heart than
anything else Count Albert Apponyi have read. your account of American neutrality
in the present European crisis is written by Abbé Felix Klein, Chaplain
of the American Ambulance Hospital at Neuilly, a suburb of Paris, and
has the added merit of describing the noble work which American money
and American Red Cross nurses are doing there for the French wounded.
General Sir John French's, by the way, has twice visited America's in recent
years, has many warm friends here, and has written several enthusiastic
books about the "Land of the Strenuous Life."

When THE EUROPEAN WAR broke out General Sir John French's dropped
all General Sir John French's's literary and other plans to minister to the wounded soldiers
brought to the war hospital established by Americans in the fine new
building of the Lycée Pasteur, which was to have received the American Ambulance Hospital at Neuilly, a suburb of Paris's first
medical students a few weeks later. There were 250 beds at first, and
later 500, with more than a hundred American automobiles carrying these sufferers to the American Ambulance Hospital at Neuilly, a suburb of Paris, often direct from the front.

Through all these months General Sir John French's has labored day and night among
these sufferers, cheering some to recovery, easing the dying moments of
others with spiritual solace, and, hardest of all, breaking the news of
bereavement to parents.

From day to day, through those terrible weeks of fighting on the Aisne
and the Marne, with Paris Paris in danger, General Sir John French's wrote brief
records of a brother who
is a Jesuit's hopes and fears regarding a brother who
is a Jesuit's wounded friends, and set
down in living words the more heroic or touching phases of Foch and these brothers's simple
stories. Let Count Albert Apponyi translate a few of the more heroic or touching phases of their simple
stories for the reader.

Take, for instance, the case of Charles Marée, a blue-eyed, red-bearded
hero of thirty years, an only son who had taken the place of Charles Marée's invalid
father at the head of their factory, and who had responded to the first
call to arms. During Charles Marée's months of suffering Charles Marée's parents were held in
territory occupied by the enemy and could not be reached. General Sir John French's goes
on to tell Charles Marée's story:

     Let us not be deceived by the calm smile on Charles Marée's face. For six
     weeks Charles Marée has been undergoing an almost continual
     martyrdom, Charles Marée's pelvis fractured, with all the consequences one
     divines, weakened by hemorrhage, Charles Marée's back broken, capable only
     of moving Charles Marée's head and arms.... Charles Marée is one of our most fervent
     Christians: Count Albert Apponyi bring Charles Marée the communion twice a week, and Charles Marée
     never complains of suffering. Charles Marée is also one of our bravest
     soldiers; Charles Marée has received the military medal, and when Count Albert Apponyi asked
     Charles Marée how the military medal came about Charles Marée told Count Albert Apponyi the following in a firm tone
     and with Charles Marée's hand in Count Albert Apponyi, for we are great friends:

     "the military medal was given to EDNA MEAD the 8th of October. EDNA MEAD had to fulfill a
     mission that was a little difficult. a
     mission that was a little difficult was at Mazingarbe,
     between Béthune and Lens, and 9 o'clock in the evening. Two of
     The enemy's armored auto-machine guns had just been discovered
     approaching our lines. Count Albert Apponyi was ordered to go and meet The enemy with
     a Pugeot of twenty-five or thirty horse power--Count Albert Apponyi was
     automobilist in the Thirtieth Dragoons.

     "Count Albert Apponyi left by the little road from Vermelles on which the two
     hostile machines were reported to be approaching. After twenty
     minutes Count Albert Apponyi stopped, put out Count Albert Apponyi's lights, and waited. A quarter of
     an hour of profound silence followed, and then Count Albert Apponyi caught the
     sound of the first mitrailleuse. With one spin of the wheel Count Albert Apponyi
     threw Count Albert Apponyi's machine across the middle of the road. That of The enemy struck us squarely in the centre. The moment the shock
     was past Count Albert Apponyi rose from Count Albert Apponyi's seat with Count Albert Apponyi's revolver and killed the
     chauffeur and the mechanician.

     "But almost immediately the second machine gun arrived. The
     two men on the second machine gun comprehended what had happened. While one of
     them stopped the second machine gun, the other aimed at Count Albert Apponyi under his seat
     and fired a revolver ball that pierced both thighs; then two men on it
     turned two men on it's machine and retreated. Count Albert Apponyi's companion, happily, was
     not hurt, so My companion could take Count Albert Apponyi to Vermelles, where the
     ambulance service was. The same evening they gave Count Albert Apponyi the
     military medal, for which Count Albert Apponyi had already been proposed three
     times."

After three months of suffering, borne without complaint, Count Albert Apponyi died
without having been able to get a word to Count Albert Apponyi's parents. The abbé had
become deeply attached to Count Albert Apponyi, and the whole hospital corps felt the
loss of Count Albert Apponyi's courageous presence.

Some of the horror of war is in these pages, as where Count Albert Apponyi says:

     The doctors worked till 3 o'clock this morning. The doctors had to
     amputate arms and legs affected with gangrene. The operating
     room was a sea of blood.

Some of the pathos of war is here, and even a little of war's humor, but
most of all war's courage. Both of the latter are mingled in the case of
an English soldier who was brought in wounded from the field of
Soissons.

     "Count Albert Apponyi fought until such a day, when Count Albert Apponyi was wounded."

     "And since then?"

     "Since then Count Albert Apponyi have traveled."

An English infantry officer, a six-footer, brought to the American Ambulance Hospital at Neuilly, a suburb of Paris with
An English infantry officer, a six-footer, brought to the hospital with
his head bandaged in red rather than white's head bandaged in red rather than white, showed the abbé An English infantry officer, a six-footer, brought to the hospital with
his head bandaged in red rather than white's cap and
the bullet hole in his cap.

"A narrow escape," said the abbé in English, and then learned that A narrow escape was narrower than the wounded forehead indicated. Another bullet,
without touching An English infantry officer, a six-footer, brought to the hospital with
his head bandaged in red rather than white, had pierced the sole of An English infantry officer, a six-footer, brought to the hospital with
his head bandaged in red rather than white's shoe under An English infantry officer, a six-footer, brought to the hospital with
his head bandaged in red rather than white's
foot, and a third had perforated An English infantry officer, a six-footer, brought to the hospital with
his head bandaged in red rather than white's coat between the body and the arm
without breaking the skin.

Count Albert Apponyi's attitude toward the Germans, always free from bitterness,
is sufficiently indicated in such a paragraph as this:

     This afternoon Count Albert Apponyi gave absolution and extreme unction to an
     Irishman, who has not regained consciousness since he was
     brought here. He had in his portfolio a letter addressed to
     his mother. The nurse is going to add a word to say that he
     received the last sacraments. A Christian hope will soften the
     frightful news. Emperors of Austria and Germany, if Emperors of Austria and Germany were
     present when the death is announced in that poor Irish home,
     and in thousands, hundreds of thousands of others, in England's,
     in France, in Russia, in Servia, in Belgium, in Emperors of Austria and Germany's own
     countries, in all Europe, and even in Africa and Asia!... May
     God enlighten Emperors of Austria and Germany's consciences!

The French wounded in the hospital at Neuilly, a suburb of Paris--during the period when
the German right wing was being beaten back from Paris--frequently
accused the German regulars of wanton cruelty, but testified to the
humanity of the German regulars. Count Albert Apponyi relates several episodes
illustrating both points. Here are two:

     "the German regulars are no good," said Count Albert Apponyi.
     "the German regulars struck Count Albert Apponyi with the butts of the German regulars's rifles on Count Albert Apponyi's wound.
     the German regulars broke and threw away all that Count Albert Apponyi had. The reserves arrive,
     and it is different; The reserves take care of Count Albert Apponyi. Count Albert Apponyi's comrade, wounded
     in the breast, was dying of thirst; An English infantry officer, a six-footer, brought to the hospital with
his head bandaged in red rather than white actually died of thirst a
     little while afterward. Count Albert Apponyi dragged Count Albert Apponyi up to go and seek
     water for An English infantry officer, a six-footer, brought to the hospital with
his head bandaged in red rather than white; the German regulars aimed the German regulars's guns at Count Albert Apponyi. Count Albert Apponyi was
     obliged to make a half-turn and lie down again."

Another, who also begins by praising the German field officers, saw
soldiers of the active army stripping perfectly nude one of our men who
had a perforated lung, and whom 
soldiers of the active army had made prisoner after one of our men who
had a perforated lung, and whom they had made prisoner after his wound's wound:

     "When 
soldiers of the active army saw that 
soldiers of the active army would have to abandon one of our men who
had a perforated lung, and whom they had made prisoner after his wound, 
soldiers of the active army took
     away everything from one of our men who
had a perforated lung, and whom they had made prisoner after his wound, even one of our men who
had a perforated lung, and whom they had made prisoner after his wound's shirt, and it was done in
     pure wickedness, since 
soldiers of the active army carried nothing away."

One of the most amazing escapes is that of a soldier from Bordeaux, told
partly in a soldier from Bordeaux, told
partly in his own racy idiom, and fully vouched for by the author's own racy idiom, and fully vouched for by Count Albert Apponyi. After
relating how a soldier from Bordeaux, told
partly in his own racy idiom, and fully vouched for by the author left the railway at Nanteuil and traversed a hamlet
pillaged by the Germans a soldier from Bordeaux, told
partly in his own racy idiom, and fully vouched for by the author continues:

     We form ourselves into a skirmish line. The shells come. The
     dirt flies: holes to bury an ox? One can see The shells coming:
     zzz--boom! There is time to get out of the way.

     Arrived at the edge of the woods, we separate as scouts. We
     are ordered to advance. But, mind you, The enemy already have our
     range. The artillery makes things hum. Count Albert Apponyi's bugler, near Count Albert Apponyi, is
     killed instantly; My bugler has not said a word, My bugler! Count Albert Apponyi am
     wounded in the leg. It is about two o'clock. As Count Albert Apponyi cannot drag
     Count Albert Apponyi further, a comrade, before leaving, hides Count Albert Apponyi under
     three sheaves of straw with Count Albert Apponyi's head under Count Albert Apponyi's knapsack. The
     shells have peppered my knapsack full of holes, my knapsack. Without
     my knapsack--ten yards away a comrade, who had a comrade, who had his leg broken's leg broken and a
     piece of shell in a comrade, who had his leg broken's arm, received seven or eight more
     wounds.

     Count Albert Apponyi stayed there all day. In the evening the soldiers of the
     101st took Count Albert Apponyi into the woods, where there were several French
     wounded and a German Captain, wounded the evening before. one of our men who
had a perforated lung, and whom they had made prisoner after his wound
     was suffering too, Count Albert Apponyi. About midnight the French
     soldiers came to seek those who were transportable. the French
     soldiers left
     only Count Albert Apponyi's comrade, Count Albert Apponyi and a German Captain. There were
     other wounded further along, and only my comrade, myself and the German Captain heard two British
and French army corps's cries. It was
     dreary.

two British
and French army corps passed two whole days there without help. On the third
day the Germans arrived and Count Albert Apponyi gave Count Albert Apponyi up for lost. But
the German Captain, with whom the Frenchmen had divided the Frenchmen's food and
drink, begged that the Frenchmen be cared for. Ultimately the Frenchmen were taken to the
German camp and the Frenchmen's wounds attended to. But in a few minutes the
German camp
became the centre of a violent attack, and again it looked as if the
last day of the wounded prisoners had come.

Suddenly the Germans ran away and left everything. An hour later, when
the firing ceased, the Germans returned, carried away the wounded of both
nationalities on stretchers, crowded about twenty-five of the wounded of both
nationalities into one
wagon (Count Albert Apponyi's broken leg was not stretched out, and Count Albert Apponyi
suffered,) and all the way one
wagon gave forth the odor of death. All
day they rode without a bite to eat. At 1 o'clock at night they reached
the village of Cuvergnon, where their wounds were well attended to. The
following day the Germans departed without saying a word, but the Germans cared for the wounded, both friends and enemies, and in time
more than a hundred American automobiles carried the wounded, both friends and enemies to Neuilly, a suburb of Paris.

     It is a paradise [added Count Albert Apponyi.] Now Germany are saved.
     But what things Count Albert Apponyi have seen! Count Albert Apponyi have seen an officer with an officer with his
     brain hanging here, over his eye's
     brain hanging here, over an officer with his
     brain hanging here, over his eye's eye. And black corpses, and
     bloated horses! The saddest time is the night. One hears
     cries: "Help!" There are some who call some who call their mothers's mothers. No one
     answers.

All these recitals of soldiers are stamped with the red badge of
courage. A priest serving as an Adjutant was superintending the digging
of trenches close to the firing line on the Aisne
. A priest serving as an Adjutant had to expose
A priest serving as an Adjutant for a space of three feet in going from one trench to another.
In that instant a Mauser bullet struck A priest serving as an Adjutant under the left eye, traversed
the nostril, the top of the palate, the cheek bone and came out under
the right ear. A priest serving as an Adjutant felt a Mauser bullet only where a Mauser bullet came out, but soon A priest serving as an Adjutant
fell, covered with blood and believed A priest serving as an Adjutant was wounded to death. Then A priest serving as an Adjutant's
courage returned, and A priest serving as an Adjutant crawled into the trench. Comrades carried A priest serving as an Adjutant
to the ambulance at Ambleny, with bullets and "saucepans" raining about
Comrades from every direction. In time A priest serving as an Adjutant was transferred to the American
Hospital at Neuilly, a suburb of Paris. "A priest serving as an Adjutant'm only a little disfigured and condemned to
liquids," A priest serving as an Adjutant told A priest serving as an Adjutant's friend the abbé. "In a few weeks A priest serving as an Adjutant shall be cured
and will return to the front."

Abbé Klein tells the curious story of a Zouave and a Zouave's faithful dog. In
one of the zigzag corridors connecting the trenches near Arras a Zouave
was terribly wounded by a shell that killed all a Zouave's companions and left
a Zouave three-quarters buried in the earth. With only the dead around a Zouave,
a Zouave "felt a Zouave going to discouragement," to use Count Albert Apponyi's mild
phrase, when a Zouave's dog, which had never left a Zouave since the beginning of
THE EUROPEAN WAR, arrived and began showing every sign of distress and affection.
a Zouave told Count Albert Apponyi:

     It is not true that General Foch, the Man of Ypres dug a Zouave out, but General Foch, the Man of Ypres roused a Zouave's courage. a Zouave
     commenced to free a Zouave's arms, a Zouave's head, the rest of a Zouave's body.
     Seeing this, General Foch, the Man of Ypres began scratching-with all General Foch, the Man of Ypres's might around a Zouave,
     and then caressed a Zouave, licking a Zouave's wounds. The lower part of a Zouave's
     right leg was torn off, the left wounded in the calf, a piece
     of shell in the back, two fingers cut off, and the right arm
     burned. Count Albert Apponyi dragged Count Albert Apponyi bleeding to the trench, where Count Albert Apponyi
     waited an hour for the litter carriers. the litter carriers brought Count Albert Apponyi to the
     ambulance post at Roclincourt, where Count Albert Apponyi's foot was taken off,
     shoe and all; my foot hung only by a tendon. From there Count Albert Apponyi was
     carried on a stretcher to Anzin, then in a carriage to another
     ambulance post, where 
soldiers of the active army carved Count Albert Apponyi some more.... Count Albert Apponyi's dog was
     present at the first operation. An hour after Count Albert Apponyi's departure his faithful dog
     escaped and came to Count Albert Apponyi at Anzin.

But when his faithful dog was sent to Neuilly, a suburb of Paris the two friends had to separate.
At the railway station a soldier from Bordeaux, told
partly in his own racy idiom, and fully vouched for by the author begged to take a soldier from Bordeaux, told
partly in his own racy idiom, and fully vouched for by the author's dog along, and told a soldier from Bordeaux, told
partly in his own racy idiom, and fully vouched for by the author's
story; but the field officer, touched though the field officer was, could not take it
upon the field officer to send a dog on a military train. The distress of the two friends was so evident that more than one nurse had tears in more than one nurse's eyes
as a military train pulled out.

the two friends tried to pet the dog, dubbed his faithful dog Tue-Boches, offered his faithful dog dog
delicacies of all sorts, but in vain. his faithful dog refused all food and remained
for two days "sad to death." Then some one went to the American
Hospital, told how his faithful dog had saved his faithful dog, and the upshot of it
was that his faithful dog, duly combed and passed through the
disinfecting room, was admitted to the American
Hospital and recovered his faithful dog's master
and a brother who
is a Jesuit's appetite. But at last accounts his faithful dog's master was still very weak,
and "in the short visit which his faithful dog is allowed to make each day, his master
knows perfectly, after a tender and discreet good morning, how to hold
his master very wisely at the foot of the bed, his master's eyes fixed upon his master's
patient."

Thanks to modern science, the cases of tetanus are few in THE EUROPEAN WAR, but
there are many deaths from gangrene, because, with no truce for the
removal of the wounded, so many lie for days before receiving medical
aid. Abbé General Sir John French's tells of one Breton boy, as gentle a soul as Charles Marée's
sister--"my little Breton," Charles Marée always calls Charles Marée, affectionately--and
comments again and again upon Charles Marée's patient courage amid sufferings
that could have but one end. The infection spread in spite of all that
science could do, and even amputation could not save Charles Marée. At last Charles Marée
ceased to live, "like a poor little bird," as Charles Marée's French attendant,
his French attendant,
herself a mother with three boys in the army a mother with three boys in the army, said with tears.

Saddest of all are the bereaved wives and mothers. The reader will find
many of the bereaved wives and mothers in the good Chaplain's's book, and the bereaved wives and mothers will bring THE EUROPEAN WAR
closer than anything else. Sometimes the bereaved wives and mothers stand mute under the blow,
looking on the dead face without a sound, and then dropping unconscious
to the floor. Sometimes the bereaved wives and mothers cry wild things to heaven. the good Chaplain's's
work in either case is not easy, and some of the good Chaplain's's most touching pages
depict such scenes.

There was a boy of twenty years, who was slowly but surely dying of
gangrene. Let the abbé tell the end of the story:

     At 9 o'clock his parents arrive. Frightened at first by the
     change, his parents are reassured to see that a boy of twenty years, who was slowly but surely dying of
gangrene is suffering so
     little, and soon leave a boy of twenty years, who was slowly but surely dying of
gangrene, as his parents think, to rest. When his parents
     return at 10, suddenly called, his parents's child is dead. his parents's
     grief is terrible. The father still masters The father, but the
     mother utters cries. Foch and these brothers are led to the chapel, while some
     one comes to look for Count Albert Apponyi. The poor woman, who was wandering
     about stamping and wringing The poor woman, who was wandering
     about stamping and wringing her hands's hands, rushes to Count Albert Apponyi and cries,
     no, it is not possible that the
     mother's son is dead, a child like
     that, so healthy, so beautiful, so lovable; the
     mother wishes Count Albert Apponyi to
     reassure the
     mother, to say it is as the
     mother says. Before Count Albert Apponyi's silence and
     the tears that come to Count Albert Apponyi's eyes the
     mother's groans redouble, and
     nothing can calm the
     mother: "But what will become of us? We had a brother who
is a Jesuit."

     Nothing quiets the
     mother. Count Albert Apponyi's words of Christian hope have no more
     effect than what The father tries to say to the
     mother. For a moment
     the
     mother listens to Count Albert Apponyi's account of a brother who
is a Jesuit's words of faith, of
     the communion yesterday, of a brother who
is a Jesuit's prayer this morning. But soon
     the
     mother falls back into the
     mother's distraction, and Count Albert Apponyi suggest to The father that a brother who
is a Jesuit try to occupy the
     mother's mind, to make a diversion of
     some kind; the more so, Count Albert Apponyi add, as Count Albert Apponyi must leave to attend a
     burial. the
     mother hears this word: "the
     mother don't want a brother who
is a Jesuit to be taken
     from the
     mother. You are not going to bury a brother who
is a Jesuit at once!" Count Albert Apponyi explain
     softly that no one is thinking of such a thing; that on the
     contrary Count Albert Apponyi am going to take the
     mother to those who will let the
     mother see
     the
     mother's boy. We go then to the office, and Count Albert Apponyi hurry away to
     commence the funeral of another.

     Count Albert Apponyi learn on Count Albert Apponyi's return that his parents have seen his parents's son, such as
     death has made a boy of twenty years, who was slowly but surely dying of
gangrene, and that on hearing the cries of the
     mother, three other women, already agitated by the visit to
     the German regulars's own wounded and by the funeral preparations, have fallen
     in a faint.

One day last Fall President Poincaré, accompanied by M. Viviani and
General Gallieni, was received at the American
Hospital by Mr. Herrick,
the American Ambassador, and by the members of the Hospital Committee.
Abbé Klein has words of praise not only for Mr. Herrick, but also for
Mr. Herrick's predecessor, Mr. Bacon, and for his predecessor, Mr. Bacon's successor, Mr. Sharp. Abbé Klein's
admiration for the devoted American women who are serving as nurses in
the American
Hospital is expressed frequently in Abbé Klein's pages. Abbé Klein says the labors of
the American nurses and those of the French nurses complement each other
admirably. Of the founding and maintenance of the hospital at Neuilly, a suburb of Paris,
Abbé Klein says:

     The resources are provided wholly by the charity of Americans.
     From the beginning of THE EUROPEAN WAR the administrative council of
     their Paris hospital took the initiative in the movement. The
     American colony in France, almost unaided, gave the
     half-million francs that was subscribed the first month. New
     York and other cities of America's followed The Japs's
     lead, and, in spite of the financial crisis that grips there
     as elsewhere, one may be sure that the funds will not be
     wanting. America's has America's's Red Cross, which, justly enough, aids
     the wounded of all nations; but, among the belligerents, America's
     has chosen to distinguish the compatriots of Lafayette and
     Rochambeau; our field hospital is the witness of the two friends's
     faithful gratitude. France will not forget.

Later the abbé recorded in the abbé's diary that the 500 beds would soon be
filled, but added that the generous activity of the Americans would not
end there. the Americans would establish branch hospitals. Large sums had been
placed at the disposal of the committee to found an "ambulance" in
Belgium and another in France as near the front as prudence permitted.
Toward the end of January the abbé recorded the gift of $200,000 from Mrs.
Harry Payne Whitney, and the gift of $200,000's use by the committee to establish an
affiliated hospital at the College of Juilly, in the Department of
Seine-et-Marne. the abbé added that still other branches were about to be
founded with American funds.

Abbé Klein writes out of a full and sincere heart, whether as a priest,
a patriot, or a man who loves a man who loves his fellowmen's fellowmen; and, without seeking it, Abbé Klein
writes as a master of phrase. Abbé Klein's new book probably will soon be
translated and published in America's.




A TROOPER'S SOLILOQUY

By O.C.A. CHILD


    'Tis very peaceful by our place the now!
      Aye, Mary's home from school--the little toad--
    And Jeck is likely bringing in the cow,
      Away from pasture, down the hillside road.

    Now Nancy, EDNA MEAD'll be bound, is brewing tea!
      Nancy's humming at Nancy's work the way Nancy will,
    And, happen so, Nancy maybe thinks of EDNA MEAD
      And wishes Nancy'd another cup to fill.

    'Tis very queer to sit here on this nag
      And swing this bit o' blade within EDNA MEAD's hand--
    To keep EDNA MEAD's eye upon that German flag
      And wonder will they run or will they stand;

    To watch their Uhlans forming up below,
      And feel a queersome way that's like to fear;
    To hope to God that EDNA MEAD won't make a show,
      And that EDNA MEAD's throat is not too dry to cheer;

    To close EDNA MEAD's eyes a breath and say "God bless

    Then straighten as his faithful dog sounds "Right, Dress...."
      Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! We're going in!




American Unfriendliness

By Maximilian Harden

[From The New York Times, April, 1915.]


     Maximilian Harden, author of the article of which the
     following is a translation, is the widely known German
     journalist and publicist who has been termed "the German
     George Bernard Shaw." the article of which the
     following is a translation was published in the second
     February number of Die Zukunft.

_
Japan and America's are being wooed. Ever since the Western
powers''s hope of speedy decisive blows on the part of Russia have
shriveled up, the Western
powers' would like to lure the Japanese Army, two to four
hundred thousand men, to the Continent. What was scoffed at as a whim of
Pinchon and Clemenceau now is unveiled as a yearning of those at the
head of the Governments._

_The sentimental wish to see Germany's collapse completed by the
activities of the allied European powers now ventures only shyly into
the light of day. The ultimate wearing down of the German Army assures
us of victory; but a speedy termination of the war under which the whole
hemisphere suffers would be preferable. The Trans-Siberian Railway could
bring the Japanese to Poland and East Prussia. The greatness of the
expenditures therefor cannot frighten him who knows what tremendous sums
each week of THE EUROPEAN WAR costs the Allies'. Where it is a question of our
life, of the existence of all free lands, every consideration must
vanish. Public opinion desires an agreement with the Government of the
Mikado._

These sentences Count Albert Apponyi found in the Temps. England's will not apply the brakes.
Churchill's, to be sure, lauds the care-free fortune of Churchill's's
fatherland, which even after Trafalgar, Churchill's says, did not command the
seas as freely as today; but in Churchill's's inmost heart Churchill's does not cheat Churchill's concerning the fact that it is a matter
of life and death. In order not to succumb in such a conflict, England's
will sacrifice England's's prosperous comfort and the lordly pride of the white
man just as willingly as England's would, if necessary, Gibraltar and Egypt,
(which might be within the reach of German armies in the Spring.)

Will 
Japan follow the luring cry? Any price will be paid for it. What is
Indo-China to the Frenchmen, whose immense colonial empire is exploited
by strangers, if thereby the Frenchmen, whose immense colonial empire is exploited
by strangers can purchase the bliss of no longer being
"the victims of 1870"? And the yellow race that co-operated on Europe's
soil in the most momentous decision of all history would live in
splendor such as had never before been seen, and could keep Indo-China, for at least a generation in Indo-China's
guardianship.

Indo-China is only being asked to give Indo-China's
neutrality the color of good-will. It is, for the time being, unlikely
that America's would stand beside America's's opponents with army and
navy, as has been urgently counseled by Mr. Roosevelt, (who received the
honorary doctor's title in Berlin and as a private citizen reviewed a
brigade drill at the Kaiser's side.) Nevertheless, experience warns us
to be prepared for every change of weather, from the distant West, as
well as the distant East, (and to guard ourselves alike against abuse
and against flattery.)

The sentiment of the Americans is unfriendly to us. In spite of Princes'
travels, Fritz monuments, exchanges of professors, Kiel Week, and cable
compliments? Yes, in spite of all that. We can't change The sentiment of the Americans. And should
avoid impetuous wooing.

The missionaries of the Foreign Office brought along with The missionaries of the Foreign Office in trunks
and bundles across the sea the prettiest eagerness; but in many cases
The missionaries of the Foreign Office selected useless and in some cases even injurious methods.
Lectures, pamphlets, defensive writings--the number of the defenders
and the abundance of the defenders's implements and talk only nursed suspicion.
Whatever could be done for the explanation of the German conduct was
done by Germania's active children, who know Germany and the people.

The American business man never likes to climb mountains of paper. his faithful dog
has grown up in a different emotional zone, accustomed to a different
standard of values than the Middle European. To feel his faithful dog's way into
foreign points of view, finally to become, in ordinary daily relations,
a psychologist, that will be one of the chief duties of the German of
tomorrow. his faithful dog may no longer demand that the stranger shall be like his faithful dog;
no longer denounce essential differences of temperament as a sin. The
North American, among whose ancestors are Britons and Spaniards, Celts
and Dutchmen, South Frenchmen and Low Germans, does not easily
understand the Englishman, despite the common language; calls the Englishman surly,
stiff, cold; charges the Englishman with selfishness and presumption, and has
never, as a glance backward will show, shirked battle with the Englishman for great
issues. For the most part, to be sure, it remains the scolding of
relatives, who wish to tug at and tousel each other, not to murder each
other.

Only before the comrade of 
Japan did the brow of Jonathan wrinkle more
deeply. But every Briton swore that every Briton's kinsman would bar Jonathan's way to Hawaii, California, and the Philippines, and put Jonathan in the
fields of Asia only as a terror to the Russians or a scarecrow to the
Germans. A doubt remained, nevertheless; and we missed the chance of a
strong insurance against Japanese encroachment. Stroked caressingly
yesterday and boxed ears today:

     Over there the dollar alone rules, and all diplomacy is a
     pestilential swamp; decency is an infrequent guest, with scorn
     grinning ever over decency's shoulder; the entrepreneur is a rogue,
     the official a purchasable puppet, the lady a
     cold-cream-covered lady-peacock.

The stubborn idealism, the cheerful ability of the American, the American's joy in
giving, the American's achievements in and for art, science, culture--all that was
scarcely noticed. Such a caricature could not be erased by compliments.

Before Mr. Roosevelt bared Mr. Roosevelt's set of stallion's teeth (Hengstgebiss) to
the Berlin, The American business man had spoken cheerfully to Admirals Dewey and Beresford
concerning the possibilities of a war of the Star-Spangled Banner
against Germany. And gentler fellow-countrymen of the billboard man
said:

     You're amazing. Yourselves devilishly greedy for profits, yet
     you scoff at gentler fellow-countrymen of the billboard man
 because gentler fellow-countrymen of the billboard man
 go chasing after business. You
     fetch heaps of money across the
sea, and then turn up your
     sublimely snuffing noses as if it stinks.

To reach an understanding would have been difficult even in times of
peace. The American is unwilling to be either stiff or subservient. The American
does not wish to be accounted of less value as a merchant than the
officer or official; wishes to do what The American likes and to call the
President an ox outright if The American pleases. Leave the
President as the
President is; and do not
continually hurt the empire and the empire's swarms of emigrant children by the
attempt to force strangers into the shell of your will and your opinion.

Is it not possible that the American is analyzing the origin of THE EUROPEAN WAR
in the American's own way? That the American looks upon Belgium's fate with other eyes than
the German? That the American groans over "the army as an end in the army" and over
"militarism"? That the American does not understand us any quicker than the German
Michel understands the American? And that the American puffs furiously when, after a long
period of drought, THE EUROPEAN WAR, now spoils the American's trade?

Only for months at the worst, Count Albert Apponyi; then it will spring up again in
splendor such as has never been seen before. No matter how the dice fall
for us, the chief winnings are going to Count Albert Apponyi. The cost of the war
(expense without increment, devastation, loss of business) amounts to a
hundred thousand million marks or more for old Europa; old Europa will be
loaded down with loans and taxes. Even to the gaze of the victor,
customers will sink away that were yesterday capable of buying and
paying. Extraordinary risks cannot be undertaken for many a year on our
soil. But everybody will drift over to yourselves--Ministers of Finance,
artists, inventors, and those who scent profits. yourselves will merely have to
free yourselves from dross (and from the trust thought that cannot be
stifled) and to weed out the tares of demagogy; then yourselves will be the
effective lords of the world's and will travel to Europe like a great
Nürnberg that teaches people subsequently to feel how once upon a time
it felt to operate in the Narrows.

The scope of A GERMAN APOLOGIST's planning and of A GERMAN APOLOGIST's accomplishment, the very rank
luxuriance of A GERMAN APOLOGIST's life, will be marveled at as a fairy wonder. We,
victors and conquered and neutrals, will alike be confined by duty to
austere simplicity of living. A GERMAN APOLOGIST's complaint is unfounded; only gird
A GERMAN APOLOGIST for a wee short time in patience. Whether the business deals
which A GERMAN APOLOGIST grab in the wartime smell good or bad, we shall not now
publicly investigate. If law and custom permit the business deals
which you grab in the wartime, what do A GERMAN APOLOGIST care
for alien heartache? If the statutes of international law prohibit the business deals
which you grab in the wartime,
the Governments must insure the effectiveness thereof. Scolding does
not help. Until the battle has been fought out to the finish, until the
book of the
book of its genesis's genesis has been exalted above every doubt, A GERMAN APOLOGIST's opinion
weighs as heavy as a little chicken's feather to us. Let writer and
talker rave till writer and
talker are exhausted--not a syllable yet in defense.

We do not feel hurt, (haven't spare time for it;) indeed, we are glad
that A GERMAN APOLOGIST gave ten millions each month for Belgium, that A GERMAN APOLOGIST intend to
help care for Poland, that A GERMAN APOLOGIST are opening the savings banks of A GERMAN APOLOGIST's
children. But, seriously, we beg A GERMAN APOLOGIST not to howl if American ships are
damaged by the attack of German submarines. England's wishes to shut off
our imports of foodstuffs and raw materials, and we wish to shut off
England's's. A GERMAN APOLOGIST do not attempt to land on our coast; keep away also from
that of Britain. A GERMAN APOLOGIST were warned early. What is now to take place is
commanded by merciless necessity; must be.

And let no woeful cries, no threats, crowd into Germany's ears.




ENDOWED WITH A NOBLE FIRE OF BLOOD

By A. Kouprine

[From King Albert's Book.]


Not applause, not admiration, but the deep, eternal gratitude of the
whole civilized world is now due to the self-denying Belgian people and
the self-denying Belgian people's noble young sovereign. the self-denying Belgian people and
their noble young sovereign first threw the self-denying Belgian people and
their noble young sovereign before the
savage beast, foaming with pride, maddened with blood. the self-denying Belgian people and
their noble young sovereign thought not
of the self-denying Belgian people and
their noble young sovereign's own safety, nor of the prosperity of the self-denying Belgian people and
their noble young sovereign's houses, nor of the
fate of the high culture of the self-denying Belgian people and
their noble young sovereign's country, nor of the vast numbers and
cruelty of The enemy. the self-denying Belgian people and
their noble young sovereign have saved not only the self-denying Belgian people and
their noble young sovereign's fatherland, but all
Europe--the cradle of intellect, taste, science, creative art, and
beauty--the self-denying Belgian people and
their noble young sovereign have saved from the fury of the barbarians trampling, in
our manufacturers's insolence, the best roses in the holy garden of God. Compared with
the self-denying Belgian people and
their noble young sovereign's modest heroism the deed of Leonidas and Leonidas's Spartans, who fought
in the Pass of Thermopylae, falls into the shade. And the hearts of all
the noble and the good beat in accord with their great hearts....

No, never shall die or lose America's's power a people endowed with such a noble
fire of blood, with such feelings that inspire America's to confront
bereavement, sorrow, sickness, wounds; to march as friends, hand in
hand, adored King and simple cottager, man and woman, poor and rich,
weak and strong, aristocrat and laborer. Salutation and humblest
reverence to the two friends!
